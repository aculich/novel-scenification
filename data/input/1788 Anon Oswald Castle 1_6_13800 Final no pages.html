<ChapTitle>A DEPARTURE.</ChapTitle>

<SceneAction>About the middle of September, <Trigger>on a morning, when</Trigger> the sun shone with all the chearful brilliance, he sometimes beams on that agreeable month, <ChNameIntro>Lady Sophia Woodville</ChNameIntro> stept into the chaise which was to convey her from the mansion of her ancestors, to the gay scenes of London. -- But the clear radiance of the sun, although it brightened all nature, and gilded the last leaves of a beautiful Autumn with its beams, had no power to enliven her heart, -- a heart enveloped in a thick gloom, which even the mental rays of fancy could scarcely pierce. —- <Monologue>"Alas!" <M>she softly exclaimed, as she looked round for the last time on scenes so dear and so delightful</M>, "Do I quit you for ever? -- Is this melancholy farewel, all that is left me of hours of happiness too swiftly flown? -- And is this sable habit, all that remains of the most indulgent of mothers? -- No, blest shade;" <M>she continued lifting up her eyes</M>, "there dwells in the heart of your Sophia, a remembrance of you, at once the most sacred and most lasting!"</Monologue> -- In saying this, she waved her last adieu to the plains of Woodville, and drawing her hat over her eyes, gave herself up to all the luxury of silent woe. She was accompanied by a maiden sister of her father's, who, without restraining her actions, was to give a sanction by her presence, to the independence of which, Lady Sophia was going to take possession; for the late Countess of Oswald her mother, although she did not wish her Sophia subject to the authority of a guardian, thought her too young, and too lovely to be left entirely to herself, and therefore entreated Lady Gertrude Woodville, would reside under the same roof with her niece, till Sophia should marry. This request, Lady Gertrude readily complied with, one of the daughters of a very large family, her own fortune was small, and her inclination for gaiety not yet over; a residence therefore, with the youthful and generous Sophia, the heiress of all her father's possessions, (except Woodville house and its environs, which went with the title to a distant relation) could not fail of being agreeable to her. She was good-natured, and Sophia felt for her all the affection a mind so much inferior to her own could claim. -- They had not proceeded far, ere the indulgence which Sophia gave to a grief which deeply impressed her sensible heart, was interrupted by <ChNameIntro>Lady Gertrude</ChNameIntro>, who endeavoured to repell her tears, with all those commonplace maxims, a heart not alive to the tenderness of sensibility, knows so well how to repeat; she attempted to awaken in her neice, a pleasure she was almost ashamed to confess in herself whenever she thought of the amusements of London. <DiaM>"Sure, my dear," <M>continued she</M>, "you cannot be sorry to leave that gloomy place, which for the last three months has been even more insupportable than usual."</DiaM> -- <DiaM>"For the last three months" <M>replied Sophia, with a deep sigh</M>, "it has indeed been melancholy; but I felt a relief in retracing those dear scenes where I had so long been happy; my grief is renewed, <i>almost</i> encreased, when I tear myself from that beloved spot, ever the dear abode of peace and virtue."</DiaM> <DiaM>"It is to be sure" <M>answered Lady Gertrude</M>, "very pleasantly situated, but at <i>your</i> age, how I should have delighted in an excursion to London; but what I would have given all I was worth to gain, you receive with indifference."</DiaM> -- <DiaM>"With indifference!" <M>replied Sophia</M>, "say rather with dislike indeed, unless I find in London more charms than at present I fancy in it, I shall soon return to the country."</DiaM> -- <Dia>"The country, my dear! -- Why all your feats are at a great distance from town."</Dia> -- <DiaM>"They are so, madam," <M>replied Sophia, half smiling at her aunt's eager surprise,</M> "and therefore the more agreeable to me; not that the amusements of London were unpleasant to me, when my spirits would permit me to enjoy them, but at present they would be highly so."</DiaM> Lady Gertrude shrugged her shoulders, and said, <DiaQ>"you will soon alter your mind:"</DiaQ> to which Sophia returned no answer, but an emphatic shake of her head, and a deep sigh, and then resigned herself to meditation, as Lady Gertrude did to sleep.</SceneAction>

The noise of London awakened Sophia from her reverie, and Lady Gertrude from her slumber; about four o'clock they were set down at their house in Portman-square, and immediately after they had dined, Lady Gertrude asked Sophia, if she were too much fatigued to go out; to which she answered in the affirmative, but begged she might be no restraint on her aunt, as she must write a note to Lord Marchmont, her mother's brother, to inform him of her arrival in town, and afterwards she could amuse herself with a book, or seeing her cloaths unpacked; Lady Gertrude, therefore, agreed to take the chariot, make two or three calls on friends she wished to see, and return about eight to tea. -- <SceneDia>Sophia, when she was gone, wrote her note, and assisted her maid in unpacking her cloaths; <Trigger>a little before eight</Trigger>, a rap at the door, caused her to imagine her aunt was returned, and she went into the drawing-room to meet her, the opposite door of which opened, and <ChNameIntro>Lord Marchmont</ChNameIntro> advanced with a young lady. He took Sophia's hand, and very obligingly welcomed her to London, then introduced his daughter <ChNameIntro>Lady Valeria Audley</ChNameIntro> to her: they were then seated, and he continued, <DiaQ>"We were to pass the door this evening, Lady Sophia, and therefore as soon as I received your note, we determined to call on you in our way:"</DiaQ> Sophia expressed herself very much obliged to them, and the usual enquiries passing, Lord Marchmont, said his lady desired to be remembered to her, and would be very glad to see her in St. James's Square; to which indeed, he brought her a particular invitation for the next evening, when they should have a small party. Sophia endeavoured to excuse herself, by saying <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"she would call on Lady Marchmont in the morning but Lady Valeria would take no denial, and said she hoped her cousin would live more with them than at home."</ReportedSpeechQuotes> Sophia bowed, and at length consented to wait on them, they desired she would come early in the next afternoon, that she might be introduced to the countess whom she had not seen many years, before the rest of the company arrived; then leaving a card for Lady Gertrude, they rose to take leave: Lady Valeria good-humouredly shook hands with Sophia, and desired she would not disappoint them. <DiaM>"We shall have a round table," <M>said she</M>, "and my young friends of both sexes will long to see my fair cousin, though I think many of them will repent it."</DiaM> <DiaM>"I fear so," <M>answered Sophia smiling</M>, "I shall not credit your recommendation:"</DiaM> <Dia>"Oh, you know very well I dont mean so."</Dia> <DiaM>"Well, well," <M>said the Earl</M>, "you have not time to explain your meaning now, therefore defer it till tomorrow,"</DiaM> -- <DiaM>"Oh the thing explains itself my lord," <M>said Valeria, running down stairs</M>, "Good night, don't come a step farther."</DiaM> Away she flew, leaving Sophia to envy her spirits, and hope an agreeable companion in her lively cousin. Lady Gertrude returned very soon after, and very willingly promised to make the visit with her niece the next day.</SceneDia>

<SceneQuasi>They spent the first part of the day alone and about seven in the evening, set off for St. James's Square. -- Lady Sophia had dressed herself as elegantly as her mourning would allow, and her beautiful person received additional grace from her sable apparel; her fine hair flowed over her shoulders, and the transparency of her complexion derived new brilliance from her wearing no powder. Lovely beyond imagination, she followed Lady Gertrude into the drawing room of Lord Marchmont.

<QuotedLit>As when fair Cynthia in darksome night, 
Is in a noyous cloud enveloped, 
Where she may find the substance thin and light, 
Breaks forth her silver beams, and her bright head, 
Discovers to the world discomforted."</QuotedLit>

They found there only her uncle and Lady Valeria, who received them with a good humoured frankness, very pleasant to Sophia, whose natural timidity and present dejection, led her to dread a meeting with strangers. <ArrivalDeparture>They were presently joined by Lady Marchmont</ArrivalDeparture>, to whom they were severally introduced, with great ceremony, and Sophia felt her heart shrink before the cold and haughty reserve of her manner, the austerity of her countenance, and the stateliness of her address, did not serve to inspirit Sophia for farther company; by degrees it wore off, -- indeed, the winning gentleness of Sophia was ill-calculated to support it; and Lady Valeria, who seemed her mother's favourite, abated not the least of her good humour. Large parties soon poured in upon them, for this small set consisted of many card-tables, and several by standers. Sophia found the introduction to them all very fatiguing, and was overwhelmed with invitations, &c. -- which Lady Gertrude took upon herself the task of arranging, greatly to the relief of her timid niece, who spent the evening very little to her satisfaction at cards, and promising to dine in St. James's-square next day, returned home with a dreadful headach, and a frame completely fatigued, while Lady Gertrude, in high spirits, congratulated her upon the admiration she had excited from the younger part of the company, and repeated many compliments she had heard on her person; to all which Sophia paid so little attention as thoroughly to provoke Lady Gertrude, who concluded at last, that with all her fine sense and good qualities, she was not without affectation.</SceneQuasi>

<ChapTitle>A PREPOSSESSION.</ChapTitle>

<SceneDia>Early in the next day Lady Gertrude and Sophia, went to St. James's-square; on entering they were informed the Countess was dressing; but Lady Valeria was in the saloon, and received them with her usual vivacity: after they had gossiped awhile the Countess entered, and though less reserved than the day before, she gazed on her lovely niece with some appearance of chagrin; then turning to Lady Valeria, said <DiaQ>"How ill you look today -— if Grace does not dress your hair better, I shall desire she may be discharged."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Dear Madam," <M>said Valeria</M>, "surely it is not of such consequence; I thought my hair was done tolerably; besides, we shall have nobody here to-day."</DiaM> <Dia>"You are mistaken Valeria."</Dia> <Dia>"Why Ma'am, who is coming?"</Dia> <Dia>"Lord Sandford."</Dia> <Dia>"Lord Sandford -— oh, he is nobody."</Dia> <Dia>"Nobody -— what do you mean? he is one of the most agreeable young men I know."</Dia> <Dia>"Do you really think so? well, he is my aversion!"</Dia> <Dia>"You are always perverse Valeria."</Dia> <Dia>"I am sorry you think so; but Lord Sandford -— surely your Ladyship cannot be serious in admiring him -— I declare, I am always ready to laugh the instant I see him."</Dia> <DiaM>"I should be very curious to know at what," <M>replied Lady Marchmont</M> </DiaM>? <DiaM>"Oh, I declare I hardly know at what," <M>answered Valeria</M>, "but there is a something in his face very droll, and he walks strangely; in short, his <i>tout ensemble</i> is very diverting. Can any thing be more ridiculous than his talking so continually about plays; for my part, I believe he is a little mad -- <DiaM>'Pray my Lord,' <M>said I to him one day</M>, 'did you know that lady who fainted away at Lady Leeson's rout?'</DiaM> <DiaM>‘Upon my honour, I did not,' <M>he replied</M>; 'but talk of that -— oh, Lady Valeria -- next week —- I am to act Douglas!'</DiaM>"</DiaM> -- <DiaM>"Do Valeria be silent," <M>said Lady Marchmont, yet unable to restrain a smile</M>, "you take great liberties in talking thus of any friend of mine."</DiaM> <Dia>"Oh I beg your Ladyship's pardon, I thought you had jested; but now, can you help smiling when he comes in -— he stalks across the room just so, <M>(mimicking)</M> and I really expect to hear him every minute exclaim "Angels and Ministers of Grace defend us:" but Lady Sophia, will you give me leave to introduce you to your other relations, they are with their Governess; let us go up stairs, and I hope Lord Sandford will make his <i>entrée</i> before we return."</Dia> Sophia very readily consented, and they ran up stairs together: -— <DiaM>"I know," <M>said Lady Valeria</M>, "my mother is half angry at me, for laughing at her favourite; and moreover, would be very glad, if his solemn Lordship would take a fancy to me; now this inclines me to ridicule him ten times more, that she may not <i>set her heart upon it</i> , you know my dear! Heavens what a couple we should make, his Lordship, who is always thinking of tragedies, and looks as dismal as Hamlet, and I, who live but by laughing. -— By the bye, Lady Marchmont, is not half pleased to see you outshine me so; but I am very well satisfied, and wish heartily you may make a conquest of this flaming hero."</DiaM> As she said this, and before Sophia could answer, Lady Valeria threw open the door, and <Blend>led Sophia into a kind of school-room</Blend>, where they found two young ladies, who rose from their seats, and were introduced to Sophia, as <ArrivalDeparture>Lady Anne and Lady Maria Audley</ArrivalDeparture>; they were fine girls, but had nothing very attractive in their countenances or address.

<DiaM>"How are you Winford," <M>said Lady Valeria to the Governess, who had risen at their entrance, and continued standing;</M></DiaM> Sophia curtesyed to her, and they all sat down: <DiaM>"Well girls," <M>said Lady Valeria</M>, "what have you been doing this morning, not much good, I daresay; what! reading again, Winford! Lord how can you pore over a book for ever, I should think, hearing the girls their lessons was quite enough: don't you hate reading?" <M>added she, turning to Sophia</M></DiaM>, who answered smiling <DiaQ>"Not much!"</DiaQ> <Dia>"Oh, dear, I forgot, I hear you are one of the grave sort: well, I hope, Lady Gertrude will racket you, the old lady don't seem to hate company."</Dia> While Lady Valeria ran on thus, Sophia was engaged in noticing with pleasure the pretty and expressive countenance of Miss Winford, whose smiles at this rattle were of that sort, through which is so easily discerned a heart weighed down by sorrow. There was in her look a kind of supplicating humility, which instantly attracted the compassion of Sophia's heart, and secretly determined her to try if she could not in some measure, remove the depression of Miss Winford, who at that moment moving her eyes, met Sophia's beaming a chastened pity; each were immediately cast down, and ingenuous blushes covered the cheeks of both. Their looks were easily translatable by a feeling heart, but, except by the parties themselves, they here remained untranslated.

In the softest tone, Sophia addressed herself to Miss Winford, and with as much respect as if she had been speaking to a princess, asked her some trifling question about the book she held in her hand. An appearance of misfortune always claim from a generous mind a sentiment almost approaching veneration, it softens and harmonizes the manner, and gives to the countenance the most pleasing expression; such now filled the bosom of the gentle Sophia, she feared to offend, where she wished to oblige; and Miss Winford, who had long been unused to such tenderness, shewed she felt it by the starting tear, which her blushes vainly endeavoured to evaporate. Fearing to oppress her, Sophia arose, and finding a motive in her heart, told the young ladies, she should visit them often if they would permit her, and she should not interrupt their studies. <DiaM>"Oh," <M>said Lady Valeria</M>, "you won't easily do that, for they never study at all!"</DiaM> <DiaM>"How is that," <M>said Sophia, smiling</M>, "with such a governess, I should think they could not fail of improvement."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Oh, Miss Winford is a very good creature," <M>said Lady Valeria</M>,"but if they won't attend, she can't make them."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Nay, Valeria," <M>said Lady Anne</M>, "though you have left school yourself, you should not tell tales, we do as well as we can."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Not quite," <M>replied Miss Winford, to which the ladies made no answer.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Well girls," <M>said Lady Valeria</M>, "are you ready to go down stairs, the first dinner bell has rung?"</DiaM> -— <Dia>"Oh, yes, we are ready, good-bye Winford;"</Dia> and <ArrivalDeparture>they all ran down stairs together</ArrivalDeparture>. <DiaInset1P>"Do you know," <M>said Lady Anne to Valeria,</M> "I got into <i>such</i> a scrape before you came up; Winford was quite angry, Maria had left the ink-stand just in the middle of my embroidery, and I threw it down, it went all over me and the floor, besides spoiling my work; Winford pretended to scold, but she knows we don't mind, for what <i>can</i> she do to us, -- and I could not help laughing, the white sattin looked so droll, spotted with black just like a magpye; you cannot think what a passion she was in, and at last she said she would not stay another hour in the house, if we behaved so ill; so then I said we could not help it, and so we made it up again!"</DiaInset1P> <MonologueThought>"What an account," <M>thought Sophia</M>, "if these girls are permitted to behave thus, how finely accomplished they must be, and poor Miss Winford, what a situation!"</MonologueThought> As these ideas passed over her mind, <Blend>they entered the dining parlour</Blend>, where they found <ArrivalDeparture>Lord Sandford</ArrivalDeparture>, who stalked across the room, with an air so tragic, Sophia could not help smiling; indeed Valeria and her two sisters were obliged to bite their lips, that they might not laugh out; dinner past with the usual chit-chat, and then <CharacterDiction>"What shall we do this evening,"</CharacterDiction> was the general question: <DiaM>"Perhaps," <M>said the Countess to Lady Gertrude</M>, "your Ladyship would like to go to the theatre, we may be there in good time; who knows what the plays are?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Oh," <M>said Lord Sandford,</M> "at Drury-lane, the most charming tragedy in the world, Tancred and Sigismunda -— Mrs. Siddons and Kemble, in the hero and heroine; are you not," <M>added he, turning to Sophia,</M> "delighted with that play, —- what fire, -— what vivacity in the royal lover, -— what delicacy, -— what tenderness in the heroine!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes, indeed," <M>said Sophia</M>, "it is a favourite performance of mine; though I must ever think Tancred's behaviour in the council a blot in his character: Sigismund is noble and attractive, -— her sentiments are exquisite, -— I do not know any character more charming on the stage, or more justly delineating female dignity and virtue, -— most others are in some respect blameable; Sigismunda's misfortunes are entirely undeserved, -— of course the more affecting."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Your ladyship," <M>replied Lord Sandford</M>, "distinguishes admirably, -— what a charming speech is that of Tancred, which begins -—

<QuotedLit>"What! -— Who shall interpose? Who dares attempt
To brave the fury of an injured King?"</QuotedLit></DiaM>

The violent tragedy tone with which he repeated these lines, as it made Lady Gertrude, who was talking with the Countess, start violently, so it excited a smile in Sophia, which a glance from Lady Valeria did not serve to lessen. It was settled, however, that they should go to Drury-lane, and a servant was dispatched to secure places: Lady Anne pleaded very earnestly to be of the party, which at last was permitted, and at Sophia's intercession, Lady Maria also. They then said they would run up stairs for their cloaks, Sophia and Lady Valeria withdrew with them: <Blend>as they entered the school-room</Blend>, Miss Winford started from her seat, and caught up a book, as if to hide those tears, which the penetrating and tender Sophia instantly perceived; but which escaped unnoticed by her cousins: the young ladies, snatched up their cloaks, and saying <DiaQ>"Good-bye Winford, we are going to the play;"</DiaQ> ran down stairs. Sophia lingered a moment at the door, -— she cast a glance on Miss Winford, full of compassion and regard, and then curtesying, followed her cousins.</SceneDia>

<SceneQuasi>They proceeded to the theatre, and arrived in the middle of the first act. -— Charmed even to agony, by the delightful actress, she then saw for the first time, Sophia gave to the play, an attention only interrupted by the tears, which blinded her at intervals, and which she <QuotesOther>"vainly strove to hide."</QuotesOther> Lord Sandford, who, in spite of his oddities, had a feeling heart, gazed with delight on her beauteous countenance, where every charm was heightened by the exquisite colouring of sensibility. The rest of the party enjoyed their own chat, and Lady Valeria rallied her fair cousin on feeing her so deeply affected. They did not stay the farce, and as they returned, Sophia begged Lady Valeria to call on her in the morning; and if it was permitted, to the young ladies and Miss Winford, she should also be glad to see them: <DiaM>"Oh yes," <M>said Lady Anne,</M> "to-morrow is our airing-day, and we shall be very happy to wait on you."</DiaM> --

<DiaM>"Then you will all come," <M>said Sophia</M>, "and perhaps we shall make a party to some morning exhibition."</DiaM> While they talked on this subject the carriage stopped, and Lord Sandford, who had gone in the other, handed them out: the subject of the play being resumed, nothing else was talked of during supper; after which, though not till a late hour, Sophia repeating her invitation for the morning, took her leave, and with Lady Gertrude returned to Portman-square.</SceneQuasi>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. III.</ChapMarker>

<ChapTitle>A TENDERNESS.</ChapTitle>

<SceneAction>With a great deal of impatience, Sophia waited in the morning, for the arrival of her young cousins, and their interesting Governess: they came at length, and after they had chatted awhile on several indifferent subjects, Sophia apologizing for taking them out of the house, said she thought it might amuse the young ladies to go to the exhibition at the Lyceum, to which they readily agreed, and with Lady Gertrude to <i>chaperon</i> them, reached the rooms about two o'clock. Sophia put her arm through Miss Winford's, and they walked on talking together, —- on a sudden Miss Winford started,-— turned pale, —- and immediately afterwards, with a cheek of crimson, returned the salutations of a young gentleman at some distance; then catching Sophia's eyes, she cast down her arm in a confusion, the delicacy of our heroine would not allow her to interrupt. The young man, who appeared by his dress to be a clergyman, presently joined them, and spoke to Miss Winford, with an expression of joy and affection in his countenance which could not be mistaken. In a low voice she asked him if he had been long in town -— <DiaM>"Near a fortnight," <M>he answered in the same tone,</M> "and you must not condemn me that I have not called on you, it has been impossible."</DiaM> Unwilling to interrupt a conversation which seemed so important, Sophia quitted Miss Winford's arm, and engaged the rest of the party in chat, that the interesting <i>tête-à-tête</i>, might pass unnoticed; it continued but a few minutes, and the traces of tears were visible on the cheek of Miss Winford, when she rejoined the ladies; her bosom heaved with continual sighs, and she appeared scarcely able to suppress in any degree the emotions which affected her. Pitying her distress, Sophia proposed to return, and when they were seated in the coach, Lady Valeria said <DiaQ>"We shall not have the pleasure of seeing you to-morrow Lady Sophia, for Lady Marchmont, I, and my sisters, are going to pay an annual visit, to a distant relation, a few miles out of town."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Are you of the party Miss Winford," <M>said Sophia?</M></DiaM> <DiaM>"No Ma'am," <M>she replied.</M></DiaM> -— <DiaM>"Will you then," <M>said Sophia</M>, "give me the pleasure of your company for the whole day; very probably my aunt will dine out, and I shall then be quite alone: however, that may be, you will extremely oblige me by coming."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Your ladyship does me a great deal of honour," <M>said Miss Winford</M>; "if Lady Marchmont has no particular occupation for me at home, I shall be happy to accept an invitation which I am sure will afford me so much gratification."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Well then," <M>said Sophia,</M> "if I do not hear from you in the morning, I shall expect you early to dinner."</DiaM> They sat down; Lady Sophia, and Lady Gertrude (who had gone in another carriage with Lady Anne) in Portman-square; and refusing an invitation to alight, drove off. Sophia found several cards of invitation, &c. which Lady Gertrude said it would be necessary for her to return in a few days; Sophia asked her if she had any engagement for the next day; to which Lady Gertrude answered, she had received an invitation to dinner, but would not accept it, as her niece would then be alone: Sophia then told her how she was herself engaged; and though Lady Gertrude seemed surprised, she did not attempt to contradict her; saying, she should then herself go out. The remainder of the day was spent in that retirement which Sophia loved; but which to Lady Gertrude was insupportably dull and tedious; it past, however, at length, and she went to bed, resolving not to spend another day thus, while she could by any means avoid it.</SceneAction> Miss Winford arrived the next morning, before Lady Gertrude went out, and at Sophia's entreaty sat down to the harpsichord, on which she performed in an excellent style: Sophia was equally an adept, and they amused themselves with alternate performances, till Lady Gertrude bade them adieu, soon after which they sat down to dinner. <SceneDia><Trigger>When the servants were withdrawn</Trigger> the conversation imperceptibly fell on the Marchmont family: Miss Winford spoke with respectful reserve of those, whom she considered only as Lady Sophia's relations. <DiaM>"I cannot help envying my cousins," <M>said Sophia</M>; "a companion, whose society would give me the highest pleasure; but to the charms of which they appear almost entirely insensible -— have you been long with them Miss Winford?"</DiaM> <Dia>"About six months ma'am."</Dia> <DiaM>"Are the girls tolerably clever," <M>said Sophia? adding with a smile</M>; "you need not be afraid of speaking to <i>me</i>."</DiaM> Miss Winford, bowed. and said, <DiaQ>"They have natural sense enough to render themselves, if they chose it, accomplished women; but, I may venture, I am sure, to say to your ladyship, they are idle, haughty, and capricious: I have no power over them, they consider me as their servant, —- consequently I cannot expect obedience, or even attention from them; and frequently laughing, they ask me, what I <i>can</i> do to punish them."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Such a situation," <M>replied Sophia</M>, "must be most painful: have you, may I ask, any thoughts of leaving it?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Alas!" <M>said Miss Winford</M>, "what can I do? If your ladyship knew the various hardships I have endured in different situations, you would perceive, that painful as this is, in some respects it is an eligible one for me."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Perhaps," <M>said Lady Sophia</M>, "if I were acquainted with those misfortunes you speak of, inclination might in some measure enable me to remedy them: trust me, dear Miss Winford," <M>added she, in the softest tone, and taking her hand</M> -— "I have not sought your friendship, merely with a view to my own gratification, though that alone might well have induced me to seek it. I could not be blind to those appearances of distress which make themselves so evident in your countenance, and I easily found the cause in what I saw of my relations. I do not mean impertinently to obtrude into your confidence, but if you will trust me, depend on my inclination, even if I should want the power to assist you."</DiaM>

The tears which streamed from Miss Winford's eyes, better evinced her gratitude than words could have done; —- unable for some minutes to speak, she raised Sophia's hand to her lips, and at length articulated, <DiaQ>"Unused as I am to the smallest appearance of tenderness, or even attention -— oh, Lady Sophia, what answer can I make to a condescension so gentle, and a benevolence so animated! Is it possible you will deign to hear the insignificant griefs of a heart, which hitherto has looked in vain amongst its equals for a friend, and never dared to hope one in a superior, living amongst the titled and the wealthy: I had begun to believe, goodness was with them, even more scarce than in any other walk of life. -— I now find my error; kindness and compassion like yours, might well compensate for the want of those charming qualities in a thousand others. Long concealed from observation, as well by the obscurity of my life, as by the inattention of the few about me, I have so accustomed myself to indulge my grief, that when I would wish to restrain it, I find it impossible. I easily discern in your eyes, amiable Lady Sophia, a kind sympathy, which melted from about my heart that cold disgust; a series of unpleasing incidents had began to form around it. —- Since yesterday," <M>adding she, putting her handkerchief to her eyes</M>, "it has been almost breaking to reveal its sorrows to a friend, and if your ladyship will suffer me to look up to you, the very disclosure <i>will</i> afford me a relief the most essential!"</DiaQ> Sophia had involuntarily wept, and now with difficulty replied -— <DiaQ>"I have often regretted there is not a term in our language to express the interest we take in the affairs of those we love, except curiosity, which also conveys a meaning so different, without a word to express it. -— I feel that tender interest for you, dear Miss Winford; but I will not consent to gratify it, by giving you the pain of a personal recital; I am convinced that if you speak to me, you will omit many circumstances, which, in writing, you might have no objection to reveal; for there are particulars which a delicate mind finds it unpleasant to speak on, though conscious of no guilt, and feeling no shame."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"I thank your ladyship for the idea," <M>said Miss Winford, eagerly</M>; "I perfectly feel, though I cannot describe the sensation you mention, and rather than make the slightest objection to your request, I would have overcome it; but since your ladyship is so kindly considerate, if you will take the trouble of reading the tedious scrole, a history of myself, must form, I will take the first opportunity of writing it, for your perusal."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Do so," <M>said Sophia</M>; "but" <M>added she smiling</M>, "there are two or three words, which I perceive are great favourites with you, and of which I must interdict the use, at least they must not be applied to you and myself; they are these -— condescension, inferior, and superior."</DiaM> Miss Winford returned her charming smile, and said, <DiaQ>"I must then search my dictionary for synonymous terms, or cease to express the feelings of my heart."</DiaQ> -— <DiaM>"Then," <M>said Sophia</M>, "you are less liberal than I had supposed —- can you really recollect such vain and chimerical distinctions? All the wealth and grandeur in the world, are insufficient, to raise their possessor to the rank of an amiable character, unless they are accompanied by real merit: do you not recollect what the Poet says?

<QuotedLit>"And what are these wonders, these blessings refin'd,
Which splendor and opulence shower? 
The health of the body, or peace of the mind, 
Are things which are out of their power!
To contentment's calm sunshine the lot of the few,
Can insolent greatness pretend?"</QuotedLit></DiaM> -—

As she finished repeating these lines, she drew Miss Winford to the harpsichord, and they spent the remainder of the afternoon in music; directly after tea Miss Winford took her leave, and Lady Gertrude came home to supper.</SceneDia>

<ChapTitle>A MADNESS.</ChapTitle>

<SceneDia>The next morning was dedicated by Sophia and her aunt to the purpose of paying morning visits; they were let in at some houses, and left their cards at many more; the last visit they paid was at Lord Marchmont's, and <Trigger>as they entered the dining-room</Trigger>, they saw the Countess seated on a sopha, with Lord Sandford sitting by her, who seemed, by his manner, discoursing very earnestly on some material point, while Lady Valeria sat tittering in one corner of the room: the moment they were withinside the door, and before they could pay their compliments to Lady Marchmont, his Lordship started up, and seizing Sophia's hand, said <DiaQ>"come Lady Sophia and assist me in prevailing on the Countess to grant me a favour, I am sure she will not refuse you."</DiaQ> Sophia, somewhat surprized, by this abrupt salutation, drew back her hand, and asked him what he meant? Instead of answering her, he turned again to Lady Marchmont, and said, <DiaQ>"I cannot imagine why your Ladyship should hesitate; is it not the most fashionable amusement in the world? and will not these ladies make the loveliest heroines that ever were seen?"</DiaQ> <DiaM>"For heaven's sake," <M>said Sophia to Valeria,</M> "what is all this about."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Oh my dear!" <M>replied Valeria laughing</M>, "you know I told you he was out of his senses, do but hear him;"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Look!" <M>he exclaimed, fixing his eyes on Sophia</M>, "was ever form so absolutely made for tragedy as that? and was ever countenance so full of arch expression for comedy as this?" <M>turning to Lady Valeria, who absolutely laughed in his face.</M></DiaM> <DiaM>"Well, my Lord," <M>said Lady Marchmont</M>, "we will consider of it, and perhaps when we go into the country, where we mean to spend a month at Christmas, we may prevail on my Lord to erect a temporary theatre, and we will try what we can do -— should you like the scheme, young ladies?" <M>added she, to Sophia and Valeria</M></DiaM>; <DiaM>"Oh charming!" <M>exclaimed the latter</M>, "I shall doat on it; and as to my cousin, I dare say she will be delighted: Lord, my dear, so much as you read, I dare say you can repeat half a dozen scenes -— do now try a little with Lord Sandford, any character you please, we shall listen with the greatest pleasure."</DiaM> <DiaM>"You are very kind," <M>said Sophia smiling</M>, "but indeed you must excuse me."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Oh! the happiest idea in the world," <M>said Lord Sandford</M>, "I entreat your Ladyship to begin -— what scene would you chuse, perhaps Almeria? -— Aye I will begin;" <M>and then most ridiculously he threw himself into an attitude and exclaimed,</M>

——— <QuotedLit>"Hast thou then forgot me?
Hast thou thine eyes, and can'st not see Alphonso? -—
Am I so altered, or art thou so changed, 
That seeing my disguise, thou seest not me?"</QuotedLit></DiaM>

He held Sophia's hand so as to prevent her sitting down, and absolutely seemed mad enough to expect her answer; but colouring deeply, and not a little disconcerted, she said, <DiaQ>"Indeed my Lord you must excuse me, I dare say Lady Valeria can answer you."</DiaQ> In saying this she disengaged herself, and sat down. -— <DiaM>"Oh spiteful!" <M>exclaimed Valeria, recovering from the laugh into which she had thrown herself</M>, "I declare I don't know a line; how can you be so cruel Sophia as not to answer poor Lord Sandford; see how he stands waiting your reply."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Mad girl," <M>Lady Marchmont called her, and desiring Lord Sandford would be seated, endeavoured to give the conversation a more rational turn</M></DiaM>; in some measure she succeeded, but still the theatre scheme was talked over, and almost entirely settled; after which, agreeing on a party to the play next night, Sophia and Lady Gertrude took their leave. Valeria attended them to the head of the stairs, and said, <DiaQ>"You are not angry with me Lady Sophia?"</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Not very much," <M>replied Sophia smiling</M>, "but indeed, it was very cruel to make me look so foolish."</DiaM> <Dia>"Oh! I should have done the same to anybody, I cannot withstand an opportunity to amuse myself, and I shall laugh for a fortnight at the idea of Lord Sandford."</Dia> —- Sophia left her compliments for Miss Winford, and then departed</SceneDia>. -— Having remarked Lady Gertrude's ennui the day before, Sophia entreated she would not confine herself, as she could find sufficient amusement in her books and music. <SceneReadingWriting>Yielding with some reluctance, Lady Gertrude left her, and Sophia after drinking tea alone, took up a book, in which she was deeply engaged, <Trigger>when her footman brought her in a letter</Trigger>, which he said came by the penny-post, and which, Sophia hastily tearing open, found it came from Miss Winford, and its contents were as follows.

<ChapTitle>AN HISTORY.</ChapTitle>

<QuotedText><WrittenNarrative1P>"The confidence your Ladyship most kindly solicits, and the pleasure I feel in bestowing it, will, I fear, involve you in a tedious narrative, very different probably from that you may expect. I therefore think it necessary to preface my recital, by observing, that I have no uncommon adventures to recount, nor any events to describe, which may not, with very little variation, have happened to many young women in the situation of life I now fill. To a person of your Ladyship's delicacy and feelings, it will be unnecessary to hint, that I should wish the narrative I am about to reveal <i>entirely</i> confined to the tenderness of your own heart.

"My father was a capital merchant, at the sea-port of <Cryptonym>L-----</Cryptonym>, he had married a young woman of tolerable fortune and genteel connections, whose death, was occasioned by the birth of her first child, that unfortunate being, who now has the honour of addressing you. My father, who passionately loved his wife, was inconsolable for her loss, and but for his fondness for me, would probably not have survived it. It was supposed from the flourishing state of my father's affairs, that my fortune would be very large, and my education corresponded with that idea. I was boarded at a large school, where I learnt every accomplishment the various assistants could give me, never leaving my studies, but at the vacations, when under an excellent house-keeper of my father's, I was also taught domestic oeconomy.

At sixteen I was taken from school, placed at the head of my father's table, and considered in all respects as the mistress of his house.

"His acquaintance was very large -— amongst the rest, he was visited by an old gentleman whose name was Clayton; he was a batchelor, and very rich, —- the particular attention he paid me frequently induced my young companions to rally me on the conquest I had made; to which I have often replied they might assure themselves, I should never be Mrs. Clayton -— Alas! at that moment how little did I foresee I should one day place all my happiness in the hope of assuming that name.

A year past away, and found me still in this enviable situation; at the expiration of that time, my father told me one day he expected a couple of friends to dinner; and at the appointed hour, Mr. Clayton entered the room, followed by a young gentleman I had never seen before, and who was introduced to me as his nephew, Mr. George Clayton. Your Ladyship probably begins to perceive, that this young man, was from that period, no indifferent object to me. In effect, our affection for each other, authorized by our friends on both sides, became as ardent, as alas! it has since been unfortunate! -— Suffer me, amiable Lady Sophia, to dwell a moment on scenes, the recollection of which, at present makes up the sum of my happiness. —- This amiable young man was exactly formed to make me happy, -— we seemed to have but one heart between us -— his person I need not describe, -— you have seen it; though probably you did not very much notice the gentleman we met at the Lyceum. -— Yes, Lady Sophia, that was my unfortunate lover, and my heart will not easily overcome the sadness it then received from hearing his sorrows -— but to proceed —- For two years this felicity continued, our friends thought us too young to marry, till the end of that time, which was fixed to ascertain our happiness; but alas! a few weeks before the day appointed, by the failure of a capital house abroad, my father became a <i>bankrupt</i>. -— Suffer me to draw a veil over that dreadful aera -— suffice it to say, the blow struck so deeply on my father's heart, he did not long survive it, and I was left <QuotedLit>"to the mercy of that rude stream,"</QuotedLit> a wide and unthinking world. All that was saved from the wreck of my father's fortune, was two or three hundred pounds, and a friend of my late mother's kindly took me into her house, till I could determine what to do with myself: "and what!" methinks I hear you say, "became of Mr. Clayton, -— could he desert?" —- Suspend your censure, dear Lady Sophia, -— he was incapable of such baseness, and continued his visits as usual, warmly pressing me to give my hand immediately, which I constantly and steadily refused to do, as such a compliance would have argued a doubt of his constancy; neither would I consent to wave in so material an instance, the respect I owed my father's memory. <EmSceneDia>One morning, about three months after the death, of that ever-regretted parent, I was sitting with my kind protectress, (who would not permit me to pay her anything for my board, though she had but a narrow income) when Mr. George Clayton entered; his looks, pale and dejected, alarmed me; I caught the sadness of his aspect, and eagerly demanded what was the matter? he affected to laugh, and carelessly said, <DiaQ>"nothing."</DiaQ> Resting my hand on his arm, I with great emotion exclaimed, <DiaQ>"Tell me Clayton, I am sure something has happened!"</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Surely," <M>he answered in a gay tone,</M> "I have a most unfortunate face, to be thus terrifying -— I entreat, my dear girl," <M>added he more seriously</M>, "you will not alarm yourself; the truth is I have a bad headach, which I suppose makes me even more frightful than usual."</DiaM> This <i>nonchalante</i> manner a little reassured me, and we sat down together. Mrs. Selwyn my protectress, was soon after called out of the room, and we continued in conversation; but his frequent sighs, overcame the serenity he had tried to establish in my bosom, and I again took up the idea that something extraordinary had happened. <DiaM>"I will own to you," <M>said he at length, finding he could not dissipate my anxiety</M>, "I will own to you, my dear Anna, I am not happy: a foolish idea, a sort of <i>presentiment</i> has occupied my mind some days past, and instead of diminishing, it hourly encreases."</DiaM> <DiaM>"What" <M>said I</M>, "is it you fear?"</DiaM> -— <DiaM>"Alas!" <M> replied,</M> "something tells me, unless you immediately consent to be mine, some misfortune will separate us for ever; nor is this fear wholly without grounds: you know I am almost entirely dependent on my uncle, and should he withdraw his consent, I must not pretend to my dear Anna, lest I should involve her in all the horrors of poverty: he is, you know, fond of money, and if we give him time to forget the love he had for your father, he may, perhaps, retract; consent then, sweet girl, to put it out of his power; in respect to your father's memory, if you chuse it, we will make our marriage known only to my uncle and Mrs. Selwyn, I --"</DiaM> <DiaM>"No Clayton," <M>said I, interrupting him</M>, "I will not yield to such idle fears; if you have perceived no change in your uncle, this is a childish prepossession; and if you <i>have!</i> —- would you wish to make me in his opinion, a girl, who, only eager for her own interest, hastily takes you at your word, lest you should repent? urge it not —- I cannot -— will not consent!"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Cruel Anna," <M>he replied</M>, "will you then suffer a false delicacy to rob us of our happiness? Ah! reflect, sweet girl, that this may be the last hour in which you will be allowed to determine, and that hereafter, we may both repent, having thus trifled it away."</DiaM> <DiaM>"No Clayton," <M>I answered</M>, "I will never become your wife, by an action I should blush to remember, and to which not even all <i>your</i> persuasions can reconcile me; let us trust to heaven for the completion of our happiness."</DiaM> I will not longer detain your Ladyship, by relating the arguments he vainly used; after spending the morning in endeavours to overcome my resolution, which was too well fixed to be shaken, he left me with a sorrow in his countenance which hurt me extremely; though, as he would not own he had remarked any change in his uncle's behaviour, I thought it very extraordinary.</EmSceneDia> I fear, dear Lady Sophia, your patience begins to tire of this long recital, which yet I know not how to shorten: without apologies or comments, therefore, I will proceed.

"A very few days confirmed my misfortunes; the elder Mr. Clayton called on me, and after great hesitation said, <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"that as his nephew's income was very small, and mine was so reduced, he thought we should not be happy together, and that, in a word, he had other views for him."</ReportedSpeechQuotes> My pride would not allow me to upbraid him, and scarcely returning any answer, I permitted him to leave me; but, the misery I had stifled while he staid, overwhelmed me so completely when he was gone, that a violent fever succeeded, and for many days I was happily insensible to the distress of my situation: when I began to recover from this blest oblivion, the elder Mr. Clayton sent me a bank-note, for fifty pounds, which I immediately returned; and engaged Mrs. Selwyn to procure me among her acquaintance, which was large, and genteel, the place of governess to one or more young ladies: in this she succeeded, and I was engaged to educate the two young daughters of a dignified clergyman. Before my departure from a place where I had experienced such changes of fortune, I once more saw the man of my affections; we passed two hours in all the luxury of unrestrained sorrow, and parted with assurances of constant attachment. The situation into which I had entered, I soon found truly insupportable, the children were so entirely indulged, that if I contradicted them ever so slightly, it produced a cry of two hours; they represented me as too cruel to live with, and of so bad a disposition, they found it impossible to please me. In consequence of these complaints, which I was conscious of not deserving, I applied for my dismission, which, (notwithstanding my cruelty to the poor dear children) I had some difficulty to obtain, and immediately engaged myself in another family. But it would be endless to particularize the various scenes I past, till at last I was received into Lord Marchmont's family, a nominal governess, and a real slave. -— Your Ladyship has seen enough of your young relations, to believe I have no power over them; and were you to witness the madness of their behaviour, when they are in spirits, and the cruel insults I suffer, when they are out of humour; the pity you have so kindly bestowed on me, would be even encreased. Sometimes they will start from their seats and dance minuets, which usually end in violent romps; during which every thing is thrown into disorder, the musical instruments broken, and their own clothes torn to pieces; to my remonstrances, they return no answer, or one so saucy as determines me not to trouble myself further with them; though it ill accords with my conscience to accept Lord Marchmont's money, without being able to make them understand any part of those accomplishments, I am intended to teach them, and which Lady Marchmont wonders they do not learn; is it possible she is blind enough not to see that their ignorance originates in her behaviour towards me? If they have no respect for their tutoress, will they regard the instructions she gives them? and can they feel any thing for me, but the most perfect contempt, while their mother treats me with little more ceremony, than she does her upper servants? Justly does a French author say on a subject like this, <QuotedLit>"L'Instituteur ou precepteur, qui devrait être aussi respecté que le père même, puisqu'il est fait pour le remplacer en tout tems; lui a qui on confie l'heritier d'un nom illustre, cher a sa famille; lui qui doit former un citoyen respectable, un sujet soumis, qui doit honorer son nom, et son rang; en faisant la gloire de la patrie. C'est donc cet homme chargé d'un tel emploi, qu'on dedaigne dans les plus grand cercles, qu'on rebute & qu'on maltraite."</QuotedLit> This evil is indeed too common, and in the family I at present make one of, we fully see its ill effects. Excuse me, dear madam, that I have written thus freely of your relations; I am sure your excellent discernment, will in a moment perceive the inconsistency of their expectations, and their conduct. 

"Till the other day, I have never seen Mr. George Clayton, since I quitted L----; once or twice I have received letters from him, but never dared to answer them. He told me in the short conversation we then held together, that he is now in orders, and hopes soon to be preferred; if he can procure even a moderate establishment, and I will consent to share it with him, he will directly emancipate himself from the bondage his uncle holds over his actions, and be happy.

"Thus, amiable Lady Sophia, <QuotedLit>"I have a round unvarnished tale delivered,"</QuotedLit> for the dullness of which, I have no excuse to offer, but your desire to hear it; and in which I am conscious the most remarkable occurrence is, that you should have interested yourself about it. I remain with the most grateful respect,
your Ladyship's,
most obliged and devoted Servant,
Anna Maria Winford"</WrittenNarrative1P></QuotedText>

<ChapTitle>A RESCUE.</ChapTitle>

As Sophia finished reading this letter, she folded it thoughtfully up, and continued some minutes in meditation, endeavouring to fix on some plan to serve the fair and unfortunate writer. -— At length, she determined to tell Lady Marchmont, she found she must either confine her aunt at home more than she wished, or sit very much alone; which, as she was naturally inclined to melancholy, she thought not right; and therefore, if the Countess could prevail on herself to spare Miss Winford Sophia would be very happy to receive her, as companion to herself: thus she thought she might at once gratify herself and the amiable Anna, till a more permanent establishment could be procured. While thus indulging the sweet hope of doing good, the sacred idea of her mother, returned with double force to her mind, and she exulted with tears of rapture in the thought, <FIDambig><Exclamation>that if the blessed spirit of that dear parent could look down, it would approve and sanctify the design!</Exclamation></FIDambig> <Exclamation>Sweet influence of filial piety! -— which even in the grave loses not its power, but continues to sway the heart to acts of tenderness and love!</Exclamation> Sophia was accustomed to consider the watchful eye of her mother as still upon her, with a privilege, its natural penetration while mortal, could not give, that of reading her thoughts; and thus conceiving, was it possible she should ever stray to any gross or essential error.

She immediately took up the pen and wrote as follows: --

<QuotedText>TO MISS WINFORD. 

"My sincerest thanks, dearest Miss Winford, are due for the interesting communication, you have this day favoured me with: rest assured, it shall never wander farther than it has already; that is, from my eyes to my heart, where it has engraven itself for ever.

Your conduct on every occasion has done you the highest honour, -— and it shall be my study to take you from the unpleasant situation in which you are now placed; for which purpose I have a scheme in my imagination, to which, when I put it in execution, you must appear a stranger; and therefore, to spare you an affectation, I am sure you could not easily assume, you shall be so in <i>reality</i>. 

Adieu, my dear girl, -— I hasten to dispatch this before Lady Gertrude returns, lest the <i>addressé</i> should excite a curiosity I am not willing to gratify. 

Believe me, with great regard, very affectionately

Your Friend,
Sophia Woodville."</QuotedText>

She had scarcely finished and dispatched this, when Lady Gertrude returned.</SceneReadingWriting>

<SceneAction>The next morning was spent in receiving visitors, who left them only time to prepare for the play, to which they had engaged to go with the Marchmonts, some time before; places were taken in the stage-box, and Sophia's dress was remarkably elegant; she looked beautifully; the Marchmonts called for them, and she stepped into the carriage with more than usual vivacity. Lord Sandford was their only <i>escorte</i>, who was under an engagement for part of the evening, which would oblige him to leave them when they were seated; but he promised to return before they would wish to leave the house. The play was one of Mrs. Cowley's excellent comedies, and the third act was begun, which engaged all Sophia's attention, when the audience were suddenly alarmed by the cry of <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"Fire;"</ReportedSpeechQuotes> the theatre was instantly in confusion, and the audience, by attempting to make their way out, rendered the scene still more frightful. --- Screams of terror and distress, -— the bursting open of doors, -- oaths and supplications, -- mixed in one dreadful tumult, terrified Sophia to agony; she jumped immediately over the benches behind her, and opening the door of the box, <Exclamation>rushed instantly into the lobby!</Exclamation> -— Here her situation was indeed frightful: encompassed by a crowd of people, who regarded only themselves, she vainly supplicated assistance; at length, her elegant figure attracting the attention of a party of young men, whose licentiousness, not even the horror of the moment could repress; they seized her hand, and said they would protect her: the terrible imprecations they used to each other, awakened her to all the misery of her state, and the sound of protection, which had at first a little relieved her, from them, was even more dreadful than remaining unassisted. <DiaM>"No, no," <M>she exclaimed, endeavouring to disengage herself from them,</M> "suffer me to return to my friends, and I will share their fate."</DiaM> <DiaM>"We are your friends," <M>said they,</M> "and we will protect you."</DiaM> In saying this, they endeavoured to force her forward; the alarm had by this time ceased, and the lobby was almost empty: observing this, she hastily replied, <DiaQ>"No, there is no occasion, I thank you, gentlemen, the danger is over, and I will return to my party."</DiaQ> To this she received no answer, but an insolent laugh, some impertinent speeches to each other, and a continued effort to oblige her to go with them. Wresting herself violently from their hold, she exclaimed, <DiaQ>"Unhand me, gentlemen, I will not go with you."</DiaQ> A gentleman advancing, used some menacing language to these insolent fellows -— Sophia, without heeding in the least who it was, caught his arm, exclaiming, <DiaQ>"Protect me, -— Sir, my friends -— "</DiaQ> and overcome by the tumult of her mind, she fainted. On recovering, she found herself in a carriage, with her head reclined on the shoulder of a female: -— starting up, ere yet recollection was fully awakened, she exclaimed, -— <DiaQ>"Lady Gertrude, is it you? -— Where am I -— where is Lady Valeria, are you all safe?"</DiaQ> To all this she received no answer; and then, more perfectly remembering what had passed, she burst into tears, and said, <DiaQ>"Oh, whither do you carry me, let me return to my friends."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Be composed," <M>replied a voice to which she was a total stranger; but whose soft and feminine tone, seemed instantly to sooth her agitated spirits:</M> "You <i>are</i> with friends, who will return you safe to your family; you are perfectly secure."</DiaM> <DiaM>"A thousand, thousand thanks" <M>she answered;</M> "but will you not indeed, suffer those young men who terrified me so much, to see me again?"</DiaM> <Dia>"Assure yourself they shall not; but be silent, or you will be again ill."</Dia> Complying awhile with this injunction, Sophia rested her head on the side of the carriage, and endeavoured to guess how she might have been placed in her present situation; but failing to conjecture, she said, <DiaQ>"May I not ask to whom I am so greatly obliged, and by what fortunate occurrence?"</DiaQ> <DiaM>"No, no," <M>interrupted the lady,</M> "you must ask no questions at present, when we get home, you shall hear all."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Satisfy yourself, madam," <M>said a voice, more masculine, but not less sweet than the first Sophia had heard,</M> "you are with those who will protect you."</DiaM> -- <DiaM>"Good Heavens!" <M>exclaimed Sophia, starting;</M> "who is that?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"My brother," <M>answered the lady, </M>"your protector."</DiaM> -- As she said this, the carriage stopped at the door of a large and elegant house; the gentleman jumped out, and offered his hand to Sophia -— <DiaM>"No, no," <M>said she,</M> "I will not get out here; this is not my house, neither is it Lord Marchmont's."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Alight, but for a moment;" <M>replied the gentleman,</M> "and the carriage shall take you wherever you please."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Fear nothing," <M>said the lady,</M> "we know Lord Marchmont, and will protect you in his name."</DiaM> Sophia then alighted, and the lady followed; the gentleman supported her up the steps, for yet faint, she trembled violently: they led her into an elegant room, and placed her on a sopha; the young lady sat down by her, and affectionately taking her hand, begged she would compose herself.

The appearance of every thing about her, convinced Sophia she was with people of fashion; and turning her timid eyes on her new friend, she attempted to apologise for the trouble she had given: the young lady, with great affability, begged she would not say a word of the matter; and then Sophia looking on the gentleman, recollected, though like a dream, that he was the very person she had applied for assistance in the lobby: covered with blushes, she hesitated an excuse for the liberty she had taken, and received the most polite and encouraging answer. <DiaM>"Brother;" <M>said the lady,</M> "while we find ourselves happy, in the assistance we have been fortunate enough to render this lady, we must not forget the uneasiness her friends undoubtedly feel; will you tell me ma'am," <M>added she, turning to Sophia,</M> "where I may send to inform your friends you are safe?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"I know not how," <M>said Sophia,</M> "to express my gratitude for your kind attentions, but if you will permit your servant to attend me to the Earl of Marchmont, I will give you no farther trouble."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Indeed," <M>said the young lady,</M> "we cannot suffer you to return till you have taken some refreshment; but if you will allow us to send, probably some of the family will come to accompany you home."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Excuse me;" <M>answered Sophia,</M> "I wish to assure them personally of my safety; if you will allow me the honour of calling on you in the morning, I shall be very happy; but for the present, suffer me, I entreat you, to take my leave."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Well then," <M>said the lady,</M> "if it must be so, give me your address, and I will call on you in the morning; for I am sure, after this fatigue and alarm, you ought not to come out."</DiaM> Sophia took a card from her pocket-book, in which was written -- "Lady Sophia Woodville, Portman-square," and gave it to the young lady. <DiaM>"Lady Sophia Woodville!" <M>repeated she, in an accent of surprise</M></DiaM> -— <DiaM>"Is it possible!" <M>exclaimed the gentleman.</M></DiaM> <DiaM>"That is my name;" <M>said <AuthorWe>our</AuthorWe> heroine,</M> "and now I entreat you to let me know to whom I am so much obliged."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Sit down then," <M>said the lady, with a graceful vivacity,</M> "and you shall hear the whole: in the mean time, Brother, -— as no adventurous knight, ever staid to hear the history of his own valorous exploits, -- go you, and order the carriage."</DiaM> He smiled, and gracefully bowing, withdrew. <DiaInset1P>"In the first place," <M>said the young lady,</M> "I should tell you who your new friends are: —- the Earl of Mortimer is our father, who sat off about a week since, on a visit to some distant relations in Scotland, which it will take him some months to complete: in the mean time, my brother, Lord Fitz-Edwin, and I, are left housekeepers. To-night we went to the play, and at the first alarm of fire, my brother assisted me out, and placing me in the carriage, desired me to wait there while he returned, to see if he could assist any other lady; presently he came back with your ladyship, and placing you by me, said he had rescued you from a set of insolent young men, from whom you had endeavoured to free yourself, and demanded his protection; that he fancied in the confusion you had lost your party, and the agitation had caused you to faint; of course I gave you all the assistance in my power, and was soon rewarded by your recovery."</DiaInset1P> Sophia explained in three words, the accident which had separated her from her friends; and in a very few minutes Lord Fitz-Edwin returned, and told Sophia, if she were determined to go, the carriage was ready, and he would have the honour of attending her. He was followed by a footman with various refreshments, of which Sophia slightly partook; and then wishing her friend good-night, Lord Fitz-Edwin handed her into the carriage, and followed her himself. At first she could not help feeling herself a little awkward, to be thus situated with a person almost entirely a stranger to her, but the respectful politeness of Lord Fitz-Edwin's manners restored her confidence in herself, and she answered him with tolerable ease. When the coach stopped in St. James's-square, he said, <DiaQ>"I cannot leave you, Lady Sophia, till I absolutely <i>see</i> you safe in the protection of your friends; if you will permit me, I will hand you in."</DiaQ> She replied, he would do her a great deal of honour: a footman shewed them into the drawing-room, where they found Lady Gertrude and Miss Winford in tears; Lord Marchmont walking about the room in great agitation, and even Lady Valeria serious: <DiaM>"Is she returned?" <M>said the Earl, as the door opened</M></DiaM> -— <DiaM>"Yes, my Lord," <M>replied Sophia hastily, rushing into the room,</M> "I am here once more, and perfectly safe."</DiaM> They all started up, and surrounding her at once, began to question her: it was impossible for her to answer fast enough, and in the general confusion, Lord Fitz-Edwin was totally disregarded; they were even surprised, when, in a few minutes, they perceived a stranger in the room. -— Sophia explained to them who he was, and how greatly she was indebted to him; to which he replied, <DiaQ>"Spare me Lady Sophia the mortification of supposing you regret the happiness I possess, in being somewhat instrumental to the joy your return occasions."</DiaQ> They desired he would take a seat, which he declined; and saying his sister would expect him, he wished them all, and particularly Sophia, good-night. She related to them the particulars of her escape, and received from Lady Marchmont in return, the following account: <DiaInset1P>"When we saw you rush into the lobby," <M>said she</M>, "terrified extremely, we called to you, and finding you did not hear, tried to follow you, but the crowd for some minutes rendered it impracticable: and here, while we attempted to make way, we fortunately met Lord Sandford and another gentleman, who hastily demanded, why we endeavoured to come out by ourselves, and where you were; we told him how we had lost you, and committing us to the care of his friend, he immediately went away, saying, he would find you if it were possible. The gentleman saw us to our carriage, which we found with much difficulty, and we have not long been returned: several footmen have been dispatched in search of you, and Lord Sandford is not yet come back."</DiaInset1P> Sophia said <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"she was very much obliged to him,"</ReportedSpeechQuotes> and seated herself between her aunt and Miss Winford, who had both been extremely agitated. Lady Marchmont advised them all to go to bed, but Sophia said she should return home; they endeavoured to prevail on her to stay there, but did not succeed; she was determined to go, because she recollected her new friend would call on her in the morning. Fatigued extremely by the terror she had undergone, she rose to depart, leaving her compliments to Lord Sandford, and thanks for his obliging attentions; when a sudden rap at the door caused them to exclaim, <DiaQ>"There he is!"</DiaQ> and immediately he entered: as he came in he said, <DiaQ>"I cannot find her -— where can I go next:"</DiaQ> then perceiving her, he interrupted himself with a sudden exclamation, and advancing eagerly, he seized her hand, and asking her a thousand questions in a breath, and before she could even think of answers for them, began to express his joy in seeing her safe again; she thanked him repeatedly for the trouble he had taken, and after a few minutes, he handed her to the carriage, which conveyed her safely home.</SceneAction>

<SceneConsciousness>Languid and fatigued, Sophia arose the next morning, not till after her usual hour; she found herself in some measure indisposed; for tired as she was, she had not slept well; her time had been spent in recollecting the various incidents of the evening, which bore to her purturbed imagination the resemblance of a dream. It appeared scarcely probable, she should have past through scenes which, but to have imagined the day before, would have filled her with terror; -— that she should have been exposed to the insults of unprincipled young men; -- that, but for the interposition of a stranger, she must have been totally in their power, she trembled to recollect: her heart lifted itself with gratitude to the good Providence which had preserved her; and next she felt it warm in thanks to Lord Fitz-Edwin: <FID>what did she not owe to him -— and how could she ever repay the kindness of his interference? His sister too! -— How very few, like that amiable girl, would have received without enquiry, a helpless stranger: -— how many, through a mistaken delicacy and prudence, would have denied their assistance to one they knew not; but she, warm, -— compassionate, -- unsuspicious -— had opened her arms, -— even to a stranger in distress. Might Sophia ever hope to recompence that charming young woman? -- could the best affection of her heart be any return?</FID>

These thoughts still occupied her mind after she arose, and they were only interrupted by the servant's announcing Lady Helen Fitz-Edwin.</SceneConsciousness> <SceneDia>Sophia met her with repeated thanks for the kindness of her visit, which she said was perfectly consistent with the goodness she had shewn her the night before. —- They sat down together, Lady Helen still retained Sophia's hand in her own, and looked on her as if she had said <SpeechImagined>"Have we not been acquainted these twelve months."</SpeechImagined> Sophia also, gazed on her, and found a form, if not perfectly beautiful, perhaps more agreeable than if it had been so: her eyes expressed every thought, and as they were her most lively feature, so they scarcely allowed you to think on any other: she was lower in stature than Sophia, but the graces of her person prevented her from being insignificant. In short, she had just that kind of elegant attraction which wins the heart without consulting, or rather before it is possible to consult the reasons. They entered immediately into a very friendly conversation; and Sophia said, <DiaQ>"I trust, Lady Helen, you will not mortify me so cruelly, as just to shew me there exists a person so valuable as yourself, and then withdraw her from my society: will you add to the obligations I already feel half uneasy under, that of allowing me to see you often."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"On one condition;" <M>replied Lady Helen, smiling.</M></DiaM> <DiaM>"Name it;" <M>answered Sophia.</M></DiaM> <Dia>"It is that you will not ever again mention, that horrid word <i>obligations</i>; if you do, I shall think you wish to remind <i>me</i> of those I owe <i>you</i> for admitting me; and, like you, I am very proud, and <i>hate to be obliged</i>."</Dia> Sophia returned her smile, and in the same tone promised implicit obedience. <DiaInset1P>"My time," <M>said Lady Helen</M>, "while my father is out of town, is quite at my own disposal; and I find already, that I shall think most of that mispent, which is not passed with you: when my father is at home, I must dedicate a large part of every day to him. It is remarkabable enough," <M>added she,</M> "that but yesterday morning, I was saying to my brother <DiaQ>'I hear a great deal of Lady Sophia Woodville, I wish we could be introduced to her; but as we are unacquainted with Lord Marchmont's family and most of those she visits, I fear it will not be easy.'</DiaQ> <DiaM>‘Oh,' <M>said he, smiling,</M> 'do not wish that for my sake, Helen, for I am told she is so extremely lovely, no man can withstand the power of her charms, and I wish to keep my heart awhile.'</DiaM>"</DiaInset1P> Sophia felt herself excessively confused at this recital, and with some difficulty said, <DiaQ>"Your Brother is by this time undeceived, if indeed, he ever <i>thought</i> thus."</DiaQ> Lady Helen made some complimentary reply, in a gay accent, and while they sat in discourse, a servant entered, and told Lady Helen Lord Fitz-Edwin was at the door: Sophia desired he might be shewn up, and in a few minutes <ArrivalDeparture>he entered</ArrivalDeparture>. Sophia rose to receive him, with that graceful dignity which accompanied all her actions; and the grateful warmth of her heart gave a blush to her cheek, which fully compensated the want of what fatigue had taken from her.

<ChapTitle>A GRATIFICATION.</ChapTitle>

<DiaM>"I AM happy," <M>said Lord Fitz-Edwin, advancing</M>, "to judge from your ladyship's looks, that an enquiry after your health is needless; they assure me you have not suffered so much as I feared you would from fatigue."</DiaM> Sophia curtesyed, and they were seated. —- While they chatted on various subjects, Sophia had an opportunity of observing more attentively the person of her protestor: a form graceful and elegant, joined to a face, at once regular and animated, rendered him a most attractive object; while the observations he delivered, fully corresponding with the expressions of his fine eyes, proved him to possess a mind not unworthy of it: Sophia indeed could have said with Miranda —-

If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
Good things will strive to dwell in't."</QuotedLit>

After about half an hour's conversation, for they seemed in no more haste to depart than Sophia was for their going, <ArrivalDeparture>Lady Gertrude entered</ArrivalDeparture>, and thanking them for the assistance they had so kindly afforded her niece, joined her in giving them a general pressing invitation, which they declared themselves perfectly ready to accept: at length Lady Helen looked at her watch, and said <DiaQ>"Do you know, brother, it is past two o'clock, and I have to dress before dinner, to which you invited Mr. George Clayton?"</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Yes," <M>said he</M>; "it is indeed time we should release Lady Sophia." "Pardon me," said Sophia, "I am going to be very impertinent but the gentleman you mentioned -— is he a clergyman?"</DiaM> -- <DiaM>"He is," <M>said Lord Fitz-Edwin</M>; "and, perhaps, so happy as to be of your acquaintance."</DiaM> <DiaM>"No," <M>replied Sophia</M>; "but I have heard of him; and you would oblige me extremely, by introducing him to me."</DiaM> <DiaM>"With the greatest pleasure," <M>said Lord Fitz-Edwin</M>, "and whenever you please; as I shall then have an excellent excuse to see your ladyship myself."</DiaM> <DiaM>"I hope, my lord," <M>said Lady Gertrude</M>, "you will never wait for any excuse, but the pleasure we shall have in receiving you. If you can take the liberty with the gentleman you mentioned, and will give us the honour of your company to tea this afternoon, we are perfectly disengaged."</DiaM> Fitz-Edwin bowed, and looked at his sister. <DiaM>"Do come," <M>said Sophia, taking her hand</M>, "it will give me the highest pleasure."</DiaM> They then promised they would, and <ArrivalDeparture>took leave.</ArrivalDeparture>

Sophia saw them depart with regret, and recollected with pleasure they should soon meet again. Her heart seemed attached to them by the acquaintance of years, and she began scarcely to remember, they had first met but the evening before. Lady Gertrude made some enquiries relative to Mr. Clayton; but Sophia evaded her questions without her perceiving it; and while they were speaking, the servant announced Lady Valeria Audley, Miss Winford, and Lord Sandford. <ArrivalDeparture>They entered at the same instant</ArrivalDeparture>, and made many enquiries after Sophia's health. <DiaM>"Oh, my dear," <M>exclaimed Valeria</M>, "has your charming protestor been here this morning —— did you ever see any body half so handsome?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Yes," <M>replied Sophia, smiling</M>, "a great many."</DiaM> <Dia>"Ah, well, you say so; but we agreed last night, after you went, he was the very man you would like."</Dia> <DiaM>"You were very kind," <M>said Sophia, laughing and colouring a little; probably, because she felt herself somewhat inclined to the same opinion</M>: "but, suppose for a moment you were right, still I may have seen many <i>half</i> as handsome."</DiaM> <DiaM>"It is well," <M>whispered Valeria</M>, "that <i>you confine</i> the supposition to so short a time; but do bestow a kind look on poor Lord Sandford, -— oh! he has been raving so, you have no notion"</DiaM> —- <Dia>"about what?"</Dia> <Dia>"Oh, about you, and Lord Fitz-Edwin."</Dia> —- <Dia>"About me and Lord Fitz-Edwin! —- What can you mean?"</Dia> <Dia>"Oh, you shall hear; I'll make him begin again."</Dia> Then throwing a little more gravity into her features, she laid aloud, <DiaQ>"Oh, Lady Sophia, Lord Sandford, has been lamenting all the morning, he could not be of any essential service to you last night."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"His lordship," <M>replied Sophia, hardly restraining a smile at the change in Lady Valeria's manner</M>, "has been very kind; and I think myself equally obliged to him, for the efforts he made, as if they had been successful." </DiaM> <DiaM>"I assure your ladyship," <M>he replied, with great pomp of accent</M>, "it was not my fault they were not; but my unfortunate stars are ever shedding a baleful influence on me, which blights my hopes continually. Fortune seems to set herself against me; and though her wheel is constantly turning, it confers no favours on me."</DiaM> This speech had an affect on the features of Valeria, which instantly robbed them of their assumed seriousness, and she tittered under her bonnet for some minutes. -— Sophia, to give her time to recover herself, chatted a few minutes with the rest of the party, and then asked Valeria where her sisters were: <DiaM>"Oh," <M>she answered</M>, "they are gone out for the day, to keep Lady Frances Moreton's birthday."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Then," <M>said Sophia, turning to Miss Winford</M>, "you are disengaged?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Perfectly so," <M>she replied</M>.</DiaM> <DiaM>"That is fortunate," <M>answered Sophia</M>; "I particularly wished for the pleasure of your company to-day, and will detain you now, if Lady Valeria will spare you."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Certainly," <M>answered Valeria</M>; "we are all going to dine out, and I should be very sorry to deprive Miss Winford of so great a pleasure."</DiaM>

Having settled this, and chatted awhile, <ArrivalDeparture>Valeria and Lord Sandford departed</ArrivalDeparture>; leaving Miss Winford with Sophia, who said to her, <DiaQ>"Will you oblige me with your company in my dressing-room?"</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Willingly," <M>replied Miss Winford</M></DiaM> -- <Blend>and they went together</Blend>: Sophia's dress was unusually becoming, and the sweet hope of making too amiable people happy, threw into her countenance an expression so ingenuous and attractive, that, lovely as she always was, she became that day more than usually beautiful. When she had dismissed her woman, Miss Winford remarked, that she had seldom seen her look so well: <DiaM>"Do you think so?" <M>said Sophia, with a sweet smile</M>, "I am glad to hear it, for I intend making a conquest to-night."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Doubtless if you wish it," <M>said Miss Winford</M>, "I shall rejoice in seeing your success."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Nay, that you will not," <M>replied Sophia</M>, "for if I conquer, I shall rob you of a lover."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Me!" <M>said Miss Winford, laughing</M>, "that is scarcely probable."</DiaM> <Dia>"Oh yes, —- you know the more difficulty, the more pleasure, is part of a coquette's creed; and I shall have so much to overcome in this gentleman's attachment to you, that to succeed will be quite a victory."</Dia> <DiaM>"I do not in the least understand your ladyship," <M>replied Miss Winford</M>; "whom can you call my lover?"</DiaM> <Dia>"Whom do <i>you</i> call so?"</Dia> -— <Dia>"Alas! I never gave that title but to one in the world, —- and he, I am sure it cannot be!"</Dia> <DiaM>"Why?" <M>asked Sophia</M></DiaM>. <DiaM>"Nay, Lady Sophia," <M>said Miss Winford, in some agitation</M>, "you are laughing now!"</DiaM> <DiaM>"I have jested hitherto," <M>answered Sophia, altering her manner</M>, "but I am serious in telling you, Mr. George Clayton drinks tea here to-night."</DiaM> She then explained this mystery to the amazed Anna, and by degrees soothed the agitation she had been thrown into by this discourse. <Blend>When the time approached in which they might expect their guests</Blend>, Sophia placed Miss Winford so that she could not be seen by any one when entering the room; her heart partook of the emotions of her friend, and when a loud rap announced <ArrivalDeparture>the coming of their visitors</ArrivalDeparture>, they both started so violently, that Lady Gertrude seemed to consider them with an astonishment she did not easily overcome. Lord Fitz-Edwin advancing, said to Lady Sophia, <DiaQ>"Give me leave to introduce my friend, Mr. Clayton, to your ladyship?"</DiaQ> She received him with the utmost politeness, and then turning to Lady Helen, introduced her and Miss Winford to each other. —- At the sound of her name, Clayton started, and exhibited an attitude and expression, which probably Lord Sandford would have accepted as an excellent representation of Osmyn. <DiaM>"Good Heavens!" <M>he exclaimed, advancing to the trembling and blushing Anna</M>, "have I really the happiness of seeing you?</DiaM> Sophia kindly took off the attention of the party, by desiring they would seat themselves; and then said with a <i>nonchalante</i> tone to Miss Winford, <DiaQ>"You have then met Mr. Clayton before?"</DiaQ> She only bowed in answer; but he said, <DiaQ>"I have had the honour of being known to Miss Winford some years: we are natives of the same place."</DiaQ> Lady Helen, Sophia, and Fitz-Edwin, then entered into a most agreeable conversation, which took off their observation from the amiable lovers. These three charming people found in each other a similarity of sentiment, and a peculiar animation, which gave life to even the most trifling observations; they found their discourse so interesting, it was with regret they quitted it, while they took their tea. Sophia addressed herself several times in the politest and most respectful manner to Mr. Clayton, who answered with an air, which seemed to express a sense of his obligation to her; while the countenance of his fair mistress, was enlightened by a joy which gave an additional grace to her agreeable aspect. After tea, music was accidentally mentioned, and Fitz-Edwin declaring his delight in that charming science, earnestly entreated Lady Sophia would oblige them with a sonata; <Blend>they therefore went into the music room</Blend>, which was completely furnished with various instruments: Sophia sat down to the harpsichord, by which she gained great applause; then relinquishing her seat to Lady Helen, she took herself a harp, of which she was perfectly mistress; Mr. Clayton performed very well on the violin; Fitz-Edwin on the tenor, though his favourite instrument was the flute, and they continued this charming little concert some time. Clayton then laid down his violin, and engaged Miss Winford, in conversation at some distance, which, fond as they both were of music, they seemed to prefer to the harmony of Sophia's harpsichord, and Fitz-Edwin's flute: the ladies then sung glees, and did not sit down to a sociable supper, of which Sophia insisted they should partake, till twelve o'clock; after which they parted with regret, though at a late hour. Sophia detained Miss Winford, only to congratulate her on the happy hours she had passed, bid her hope a long continuance of them, and then sent her home in her carriage; saying, she should call in the morning on Lady Marchmont.</SceneDia>

<SceneConsciousness>She then retired to rest, charmed with her new friends, and fulfilling Lady Gertrude's prophecy, in regard to her determination of not staying long in London, which she found too delightful to think of leaving soon. Amongst other thoughts which prevented her sleeping, she could not help wishing to know, whether Fitz-Edwin found any of that danger from her, his sister said he had so much dreaded: in order to discover whether or not he did, she engaged in the pretty employment of recollecting every thing he had said, and every thing he had looked: <FID>he had not <i>said</i> much, but he <i>had</i> looked, —- yes, his eyes had seemed to declare he did not think ill of her</FID>; she had seldom met with a man who had complimented her less, yet never with one whose compliments had been so flattering to her: —- <FID>it is very strange how this could be, —- but his manner, —- it had something so marked, —- so pointed, —- he seemed to say nothing without thought; and then, there was a sincerity in his address, very singular, and equally pleasing.</FID> In the midst of these reflections, sleep overtook her, and she rose in the morning in high spirits.</SceneConsciousness>
