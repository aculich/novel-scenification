<ChapContents><i>The Story commences. —-- Alberto takes Leave of his Friend, and departs for his Regiment with blunt Michael —-- gains the Favour of Count X ——- accompanies him to England. -—- Hint at an Amour in that Country. --- Promotion.</i></ChapContents>

<ChBio>It was soon after the period that Tuscany became subject to the House of Austria, when Alberto quitted the academies of Florence, at which he had been educated, and where he had acquired no superficial knowledge of the various arts and sciences, for which those seminaries had made themselves remarkable. They did not, however, solely engage his attention, for he had, from his earliest years, felt an ardent inclination towards a soldier's life, and was now determined to share in the renown which so often followed the Imperial banner. Alberto was the younger brother of the Marquis de <Cryptonym>C**</Cryptonym>, a Florentine nobleman, who had lately succeeded to the title and estates of their illustrious family, who approved of his intentions, assured him that he might at all times rely upon fraternal protection, and procured through the Grand Duke an immediate attention to his wishes. He received a commission in a regiment of Austrian hussars, and prepared for immediate departure from his native country.</ChBio> <SceneDia>But one day did he tarry to interchange the vow of everlasting friendship with Salviati, a rich merchant of Leghorn. One day was no long time, for their intimacy had subsisted many years, and many years might be expected to revolve before they met again. Salviati was at his estate in Pisa, and had received notice of Alberto's intention. They met with their usual cordiality; <RhetoricalQ>but was it possible that they should meet with their usual cheerfulness?</RhetoricalQ> <Exclamation>Ah, no!</Exclamation> 'Tis true they attempted it; but the unbidden tear and trembling grasp betrayed what passed within: not that Salviati disapproved of the project, far otherwise; he too had been consulted: he had given it his fullest acquiescence and support: he fondly anticipated its probable success: he already beheld the companion of his youth surrounded by victory and honours. But still, had all these been certain, the present moment would have been painful, for it was the moment of separation.

Talk not to <AuthorI>me</AuthorI>, ye frigid moralizing prosers, of "It's all for the best —- we shall be so much the happier when we meet again." This is very proper as death-bed consolation, or may do well enough for boarding-school misses, who leave home at Christmas to return at Midsummer; but <AuthorI>I hate</AuthorI> such paltry threadbare comfort, and would willingly run twenty miles at any time to avoid it.

<DiaM>"And never shall I look on this," <M>proceeded Salviati, pointing to the portrait of Alberto</M>, "without calling to mind the solemn promise which I to-day have made. Your wife, though below the rank, from which custom had ordained (I pretend not to say how wisely) that you should choose a companion for your bed, was still your wife."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh that I could say she is still my wife," <M>exclaimed Alberto:</M> "not all the dread of my brother's resentment —---"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Of this no more," <M>observed Salviati, interrupting him</M>, "you cannot recal her from the grave. I charge you," <M>continued he, taking the hand of his friend with a look of benignity, which none but those possessed of a good heart can assume</M>, "I charge you, Alberto, when far from Italy, to recollect my words. -- Disturb not your peace of mind, and injure not your health by unavailing regret. Your son, however the pride of family may make it necessary that his birth should at present be concealed, will not be in my eyes the less your son. Providence already smiles upon my union with the idol of my heart, and I trust that but few months will elapse, ere she will bless me with a playmate for your Theodore. He shall be educated with my child. I am certain that to make you easy I need say no more."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"True, true!" <M>cried Alberto, his utterance half choaked with tears</M>. —-"Write often."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I will," <M>replied Salviati</M>, "that I may with greater right expect to hear often from my friend. Farewel!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I shall remit," <M>said Alberto, with more firmness</M>, "whenever a cornet's pay ----"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nonsense!" <M>exclaimed Salviati</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Write often," <M>repeated Alberto, deeply affected</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nay," <M>stammered Salviati</M>, "let us not part thus. Remember your heroic destination."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Farewel!" <M>said Alberto, still more agitated</M></DiaM>; and <SpeechImagined>"Farewel"</SpeechImagined> would Salviati again have said, but that he felt he should be still more inarticulate.

They embraced, and parted.</SceneDia>

<Sententia>Oh, friendship! next to love the greatest blessing upon earth, he, who has ever felt thine influence in its purity, will understand what passed within the generous souls of these two worthy men.</Sententia> <Reader>But see!</Reader> Already are Alberto, and his faithful servant Michael, proceeding over the borders of Tuscany: <AuthorWe>let us</AuthorWe> accompany them.

<SceneAction>The sun had scarcely tipt with gold the spires of Florence; yet had <AuthorWe>our</AuthorWe> travellers left a full league behind them. Alberto cast a glance at the surrounding, scenery long familiar to him, yet perhaps never to be so again.

<DiaM>"Adieu! dear native fields," <M>murmured he</M>. "Peace be to you, while I hasten to the wars."</DiaM>

And now they had reached the summit of a steep ascent —- but a few yards further, and the fertile vales of Tuscany were to be entirely hidden from their sight. <Sententia>There is scarcely an animal in creation, <AuthorI>as I think</AuthorI>, which is not in some degree sensible of that same quality called by us rational beings Amor Patriæ.</Sententia> Alberto checked his horse, that he might cast another "lingering look behind." The horse turned as it were instinctively, and in this would have been directly followed by his four-legged companion, but that Michael forbade it by a smart jirk of the bridle, and pushed to the rear of his master, that be might not intercept the view. Here he drew forth, and uncorked, a large leathern flaggon. The sight of it reminded him of many a merry hour —- he paused for a few moments, lost in thought. Alberto heaved a deep sigh, wiped away another tear, and was proceeding, when the ludicrous solemnity of his servant's appearance fixed his attention:

<DiaM>"Right, Michael!" <M>said he</M>, "drink, honest fellow. 'Tis the last drop of Tuscan vintage which thou wilt taste for many a day."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Good," <M>answered Michael, as his master gallopped off</M>.</DiaM> He raised his bottle and chin together, poured down a pint of comfort, pocketed his leathern companion, and applied his spurs.</SceneAction>

Had the God of Love lent wings to Alberto's impatience, he could hardly have proceeded with greater rapidity. Michael trembled for the <i>cattle;</i> but knowing his duty, and having at all times a propensity to be sparing of his words, he kept his station at his master's heels, secretly praying to all the saints in the Almanack, that some one of the numerous houses of entertainment which they passed would at length induce him to rest awhile. The prayers, however, did not prevail, till his master's horse began at length to shew symptoms of fatigue. The animal, at other times so nettlesome and eager, gradually reduced its pace to a short trot. A wretched apology for an inn presented itself —- they alighted, but only for an hour —- no time was lost —- the young soldier panted to behold the confines of Bohemia.

War had been awhile suspended by winter; but all the troops, belonging to the House of Austria, were ordered to hold themselves in readiness. This was the time for the hero to earn laurels -- this was the time for ardent youths to gain promotion by their merit.

<SceneQuasi>Not far from Lintz Alberto met travellers, who announced that various regiments were already in motion —- his heart was with them.

<DiaM>"Michael," <M>said he, alighting at the Black Eagle</M>, "order a post-chariot, and follow with the horses leisurely, according to directions, which I shall leave with you."</DiaM>

"Good," answered Michael</SceneQuasi>

The regiment to which Alberto was appointed, had not yet left a fortified town of Bohemia when he joined. It was commanded by Count <Cryptonym>X--</Cryptonym>, a nobleman, who had made himself conspicuous as an upright penetrating statesman, and a cool intrepid warrior. He was, moreover, a particular admirer of learning and the arts; and never failed to patronize those who possessed the excellent qualities, for which he himself was so eminently distinguished. Nor were opportunities waning, in which he could do this to some purpose, from his high situation in the favour of the Empress-Queen, who frequently condescended to ask his opinion upon national questions, as well civil as military.

That Alberto should have been accidentally placed under such a commander was to him a most fortunate event. Scarcely had a week elapsed after the cornet's arrival ere the count began to suppose him a proper object of regard. Being, however, not in the habit of forming hasty conclusions, his lordship employed several months in calm investigation. The young Florentine was employed in many skirmishes, and on several expeditions of enterprise, all of which redounded much to his honour, and procured him the increasing esteem of his patron who mentioned him at Vienna in terms of the highest encomium, and in the course of the same year obtained for him promotion.

About this time the Austrian government began to fear that Great Britain would form a treaty, which might essentially militate against some project of the former. To ascertain whether the conjecture was well founded, it was resolved that Count X—- should go to England, not in any ostensible public capacity, but apparently as a German nobleman upon his travels. For this purpose he assumed the name of Baron <Cryptonym>F----</Cryptonym>, and being desired to take with him a secretary, appointed Alberto to that office; who, however, during their residence of three months in London, bore the same name, and was introduced as his nephew to the numerous families of distinction with which he there became acquainted. Alberto was in every respect well qualified for the office to which he had been appointed. He was perfect master of the English language, and likewise possessed a countenance and manner highly in his favour, so that he the more easily gained access to those who could best supply him with authentic intelligence as to the object of his patron's mission.

This being accomplished, the <i>soi-disant</i> Baron and his nephew returned to Vienna, soon after which the former was appointed to an extensive command, and the latter received a troop, accompanied by an assurance of entire satisfaction on the part of the empress.

Attentive, however, as Alberto had been, during his abode in this country, to the interests of the power by whom he was employed, yet had he not failed to recommend himself in a great degree to the favour of the fair-sex. <AuthorI>On this subject I could here lay open a few particulars, which are little suspected, and which have an intimate connexion with my story. My only reason for not doing it is, that I am quite sure most other authors would. Do not suppose, reader, that I mean to disappoint <Reader>you altogether; you shall know</Reader> all in time; but I must introduce it in my own way —- not according to regular progression, like contemporary bunglers, but unexpectedly —- by a literary <i>coup-de-main</i>. I despise a mechanical march in ordinary time, at the rate of so many paces per minute. -- No, I belong to the light irregular troops, who skirmish, scour, and scamper over the country just as inclination leads them.

But I should attend, at present, to the hussars. I have brought Alberto back to his regiment, crowned with honour and approbation.</AuthorI> There <AuthorWe>let us</AuthorWe> leave him awhile in his rapid progress towards the rank he afterwards obtained.

Meanwhile Alberto's son encreased in growth as well as knowledge; and held forth the most favourable presage of becoming an ornament to any situation of life, which he might be destined to fill. Salviati's hopes had been happily realized. Soon after his friend's departure, he beheld with rapture the first smile of his son Ludovico. Scarcely had two years more elapsed ere a daughter hailed the light; but his happiness on this occasion was immediately succeeded by a calamity which threw a gloom over all his future prospects. Amelia, the faithful companion of his joys and cares, became dangerously ill: a raging fever triumphed over her delicate constitution, and she expired in the arms of her adoring husband. Perhaps no letter of heartfelt affliction was ever yet perused than that which Salviati, when reason had resumed her sway, addressed to Alberto. Happy, —- yes, even amidst misfortunes, happy is the man, whose head and heart can, by reciprocal assistance dictate lines like those. <AuthorI>They lie before me, and I feel a strong inclination to transcribe them —- but why at so early a period dwell upon a melancholy subject? Trust me, I have sorrow enough in store.

From the small portion of my narrative yet introduced, it is probable that Alberto may be considered as the hero of it, than which no supposition can be more erroneous. It is requisite that fathers should exist before their children can be brought upon the tapis. The truth is, I have no particular hero; yet I shall probably introduce as many as ever Homer did. In the number of heroines I shall beat the old Grecian hollow; and in order to set about it seriously, I here make a flying leap of more than a dozen years.</AuthorI>

Alberto's rapid promotions in the army naturally induced him to wish that his son Theodore should adopt the same profession, and in the same service, where he had so many opportunities of aiding a young man's <i>entré</i> into life.

<SceneDia><Trigger>One evening</Trigger> Salviati was enjoying the breeze in his garden at Pisa —- his daughter Amelia was harmlessly plucking a rose-bud here and there, while Theodore and Ludovico were engaged by more manly employment. A servant appeared, and delivered to Salviati what was at all times one of his highest gratifications —- a letter from Alberto. It treated of the subject just alluded to; but let it speak for itself.

<QuotedText>My dear friend,
I no longer need assure you with what sincere pleasure I read every line which is traced by your pen. This day, after a portion of fatigue, which would play the devil with some of our less hardened countrymen, I found at the guard-house your welcome letter. Yes, my good Salviati, you are right as to Theodore —- he is now sixteen years of age, and it is time that he learnt to wield a sabre. What a delight it affords to me, that his propensities so exactly accord with my wishes as to his future life! It cannot be long before I have an opportunity of procuring for him a desirable post —- expect, therefore, a sudden signal. I would not for the world that he should leave your roof, and lose your invaluable counsel, till summoned to a camp, and to a father's fond embrace. I know what will be your feelings, and you, who were so Well acquainted with the eager impatience, which you used to laugh at in former days, may guess at mine —- expect, therefore, a sudden signal. Would that your mercantile concerns might allow you to be the companion ef my Theodore! Can you not contrive it? I have some stronger reasons for the wish than I now can mention; they particularly relate to the future destination of your own son, towards whose welfare, if in my power, I should be the most ungrateful of mortals if I did not endeavour to provide. Salviati, observe my words. I form this opinion partly from you own letters.
Immense as are the riches you have acquired by commerce, and enviable as is your pre-eminence among that respectable body of the community, which have been at once the chief props and ornaments of Florence, I mean its merchants -— he is not destined to be one. Theodore's letters also convince me that such is the case; for his companion Ludovico's frolics are a constant topic of them. But no more of this at present. We must give the matter a fair discussion over a bottle of hock in my tent —- were it possible, I would say in your house. We take the field at day-break to-morrow. God bless you! Shake hands withthe young warrior for me. I send you inclosed a draft for a thousand rixdollars.
Your's till death, 
ALBERTO DE C**.
Colonel of the Fifth Austrian Hussars.</QuotedText>

<DiaM>"Boys!" <M>called Salviati, as soon as he had read this letter</M>.</DiaM> Theodore and Ludovico approached from an adjoining arbour, each carrying a foil.

<DiaM>"At your old favourite pastime I see," <M>said Salviati, with a smile</M>. "Theodore, I have good tidings for you. We shall soon part."</DiaM>

<DiaM><i>"Part,"</i> <M>cried Theodore</M>, "and <i>good</i> tidings, Sir! Can I believe intelligence which contradicts itself?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"How so?" <M>rejoined his foster-parent</M>. "Have you deceived both your worthy father and me? Are you satisfied with the harmless weapon at present in your hand? Are you contented with this calm retreat?"</DiaM> Theodore listened with surprise and expectation. Ludovico's glowing look seemed to reproach his silence.

<DiaM>"Explain —- I pray, explain," <M>said the former</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That will I," <M>answered Salviati</M>. "Colonel Alberto, alike illustrious by merit and by rank, gives notice that you every hour may hope his summons to the Austrian camp."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"To the camp!" <M>exclaimed Theodore</M>, "this alone, if any thing, would reconcile me to the parting. But, oh Sir, let me not leave you -— yet my father —- my country —- could I but serve my country -— could I, without losing you ——--"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Check this conflict of your inclinations," <M>said Salviati</M>, "and hear me. It is true that I have supported you through the tender years of childhood. Friendship towards Alberto, induced me carefully to sow the seeds of virtue in your heart. It is well: I reap at this moment a full harvest in those tears of gratitude. I see you find it painful to forsake me."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Painful indeed!" <M>exclaimed Theodore</M>. "My brother and sister too, for such I ever must consider them. Oh, Sir, I beseech you, write again; let me remain here; let me remain where my heart ----"</DiaM>

He hesitated; a faint blush overspread his cheek. Ludovico turned away, and retired to a short distance —- his arms were folded, and his eyes riveted to the ground. Amelia placed her hand upon her father's shoulder, and rested her head against it. Salviati proceeded:

<DiaQ>"But you quit the guide and companion of your early youth to embrace a parent. Think, Theodore; to kneel at the feet, to fly into the arms of him that gave you birth. To fight at his side. To conquer the enemies of the Grand Duke under his eye!"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"It is, it is a glorious prospect!" <M>cried Theodore</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Glorious and irresistible!" <M>shouted Ludovico, rushing forward, and seizing the hand of his companion</M>. "Oh, had your lot been mine!"</DiaM> His breast heaved high; ardent desire appeared to fill his soul.

<DiaM>"Ludovico," <M>said the worthy merchant</M>, "restrain these sallies of an impetuous spirit. The upright peaceful citizen is as praiseworthy as the hero who defends our rights. Enough at present! We do not separate to-day; perhaps not even this week, or month. Resume your sports, while I retire to answer my brave friend."</DiaM>

He went, but far away had fled all inclination to amusement. <ArrivalDeparture>Amelia retired to her chamber</ArrivalDeparture>, there to sigh in solitude for the loss of her brother Theodore, while Ludovico, not less unwilling to be parted from him, almost forgot the sorrow such an event would occasion, in envy of his great and glorious destiny.

<DiaM>"Forgive me," <M>said he, taking Theodore's hand</M>, "I seem, no doubt, ill-humoured towards you; but were the enemy at this moment aiming a death-blow at your head, I should convince you ----"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Dear Ludovico," <M>interrupted Theodore</M>, "I understand you. Would that we had been associates in my new career!"</DiaM>

Ludovico seized his hand. <DiaM>"Ha!" <M>exclaimed he</M>, "remember what you at this moment say: promise me that you will, if possible, prevail upon your father to intercede with mine."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That I do sincerely," <M>answered Theodore</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Enough, enough!" <M>cried Ludovico</M>. "Often have I heard my father say he could refuse Alberto nothing. Now I am well —- now I am happy, and can breathe freely. Come, Theodore, take up your foil. Another hit before we go to supper."</DiaM></SceneDia>

But know you, <Reader>fair lady</Reader>, <RhetoricalQ>why a blush tinged Theodore's cheek, while he conversed with Salviati, and inadvertently made mention of his heart?</RhetoricalQ> <RhetoricalQ>Could love so soon have touched it?</RhetoricalQ> <Sententia>Possible, and even probable; for, strange as it may seem, the nymphs and swains in Italy are still sooner victims to the little urchin's power than in our colder climate; though many are with us the youths and damsels, who, before they reach their seventeenth year, at least <i>fancy</i> themselves in love.</Sententia>

<Apostrophe>Amelia, then, you look upon as the object of Theodore's regard?</Apostrophe> —— <SpeechImagined>"Wrong!"</SpeechImagined> as his father's servant, honest Michael, would have briefly said. <AuthorI>It becomes not me,</AuthorI> however, to remain so brief.

New to Salviati's villa at Pisa, a widow had for several years resided upon moderate means. She and her only daughter, Maria, were frequent visitors at the good merchant's house, when he retired thither from his occupations at Leghorn. She had attended at the death-bed of his still much-lamented wife —- she too had lost in early life a husband, on whom she doted: and as they sat in the shade, recounting to each other sufferings understood by none so well, their tears would drop in unison.

Maria was, on these occasions, the playmate of the other children. Her placid mind and gentle temper suited Theodore: he always selected her as his companion —- he always felt a sweet unknown pleasure when Salviati sent him to request that her mother would bring her to pass the evening without ceremony. He himself knew not, however, till the period at which we are now arrived, that he should find it so difficult to leave her. It was with astonishment he felt, that to quit his benefactor was almost easier than to quit Maria, and it hurt him even to think of announcing the separation, as if innocently certain that any thing, disagreeable to himself must be unwelcome to Maria.

Two months had passed since Salviati received the letter of his friend; and yet the sudden signal, he was led to expect, had not arrived. The words in it, which related to his own son had, however, made a deep impression on his mind; and, together with his affection for Theodore, as well as a wish to shake Alberto by the hand, had determined him to arrange his affairs in such a manner, as would allow his absence from home.

<SceneAction>Theodore and Ludovico were returning from a ramble, and had almost readied the villa, <Trigger>when</Trigger> their attention was arrested by a vicious horse, which suddenly plunging from one side of the road to the other, not only threatened destruction to its rider, but to every neighbouring passenger. The animal, as if conscious of, and glorying in, the terror he inspired, foamed with fury, reared high in the air, and redoubled every effort to disengage himself from the constraint of the curb. This he at length effected, and the traveller was thrown at the feet of our young friends. Theodore instantly stooped to assist him, while the fiery Ludovico sprung forward at the same moment, seized the bridle of the prancing beast, and vaulted upon his back.

Amazement struck the numerous spectators, who were now assembled on the spot; and this amazement increased as they beheld the skill and resolution with which he combated the efforts of the furious animal; at one time holding him in tight subjection, at another suffering him to waste his strength by unavailing plunges.

<DiaM>"Strange!" <M>said the original rider, as he stood by the side of Theodore, and coolly eyed his intrepid friend</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You are not much hurt, I hope," <M>observed Theodore</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No," <M>answered he</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I don't like your horse at all," <M>rejoined Theodore</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I do," <M>replied the stranger</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What! after trying by all the means in his power to kick your brains out?" <M>exclaimed the youth</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes," <M>said the traveller</M>.</DiaM>

Ludovico now rode up to them, and alighted.

<DiaM>"There's your nag, my honest fellow," <M>exclaimed he, delivering the bridle</M>: "he's rather more quietly disposed than when I took him in hand."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"True," <M>replied the man</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What's your opinion of my manage?" <M>demanded Ludovico</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Good," <M>answered Michael, for Michael it was who came with the promised summons, and who, being more merciful to his horse than Alberto formerly was, when hastening to the border of Bohemia, had on the road thought oftener about the food than the speed of his beast; and had several times nearly fallen a victim to his mistaken kindness</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Follow us, friend," <M>said Ludovico</M>, "the crowd will only be troublesome to you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Can't," <M>answered he, rolling his eyes around</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You seem to be looking for the house of some particular person," <M>observed Ludovico</M>. "We can direct you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Salviati," <M>said Michael</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Indeed!" <M>cried Theodore, with a look of sudden anxiety</M>. "And your foreign habit! Come you from Germany? Whom seek you?"</DiaM>

Michael turned towards him at the question, and beheld at once every feature of his master, as he well could recollect them many a year before.

<DiaM>"You, you!" <M>exclaimed he, clasping his hands together in wonder of the likeness</M>.</DiaM>

Michael had lived considerably more than half a century, yet this was the first time he had ever been known, by word or look, to express any token of surprise.

<DiaM>"Why stay here?" <M>demanded Ludovico, in a tone approaching to dejection</M>; "let us take you to my father."</DiaM>

They proceeded, and Michael delivered his credentials to the friend of his master.

<DiaM>"Welcome thou wouldst have been at all events," <M>said Salviati, after perusing Alberto's letter</M>; "but thou art trebly so from the character I here read of thee."</DiaM>

Michael bowed, and made no reply. Ludovico stood near him —- the downcast altered look of the youth, who but so lately, in the face of hundreds, with bold determination tamed his horse, did not escape his notice.

<DiaM>"Thou art no doubt fatigued," <M>continued Salviati</M>: "retire, and my best fare be thine. To-morrow Theodore and I proceed with thee to Austria."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You too!" <M>exclaimed Ludovico, wildly raising his eyes —- they met his father's, and again sunk</M>.</DiaM> Michael felt as if he ought not yet to go.

<DiaM>"Why start, my son?" <M>demanded Salviati; but Ludovico was silent; his burning wishes seemed to swell in every vein.</M> "Well, well," <M>proceeded his father</M>, "I see how it is. You too shall accompany us. You will be a consolation to me as I return, after leaving my dear friend Alberto, and our good Theodore."</DiaM>

<MonologueThought>"<i>He</i> return!" <M>muttered Michael to himself</M>.</MonologueThought>

<DiaM>"Indeed, indeed!" <M>cried the transported Ludovico</M>. "Shall I, may I, oh, my kind father, how shall I find words ----"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Good," <M>said Michael, and left the room</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"So soon!" <M>observed Theodore</M>. "To-morrow did you say, Sir?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It is your father's wish," <M>answered Salviati</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Then far from me," <M>returned Theodore</M>, "be the idea of opposing it. Oh, how my heart will throb when pressed to his! But Amelia, who is with her aunt at Leghorn; and the good widow Signora Ursula —- and —- and —- Maria; and may I not bid them farewel?"</DiaM>

Salviati smiled: <DiaM>"I will condole with my daughter for your departure, when I return. She is too far off, but if you wish to take leave of Signora Ursula, <i>and, and</i> Signora Maria, why go; they live bard by. Mark me, however," <M>continued he, raising his forefinger</M>, "I expect you here again in an hour at the furthest."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Depend on it," <M>exclaimed Theodore, <ArrivalDeparture>and rushed out of the apartment</ArrivalDeparture></M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"How gradual," <M>thought Salviati</M>, "yet how complete is the alteration in almost every human being's nature! How will this boy, when ripened into manhood, smile at the romantic notions by which he at this moment is inspired!"</DiaM></SceneAction>

<SceneDia><Graft>Theodore</Graft> had, in the mean time, flown across the hall, had thrown open the front-door, and had reached the bottom of the steps at a single spring, before he perceived that there stood Maria.

<DiaM>"Dear Maria!" <M>cried he</M>, "you here! I was going to call on you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And I on you," <M>answered the trembling girl</M>: "we just now heard, from several neighbours, that you had been thrown, and much hurt by a bad restive horse. My mother bade me haste to learn the truth."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Come in, then," <M>said Theodore</M>, "it is like all other foolish stories. I never crossed the horse. But dear Maria, I have something to tell you -— something of consequence."</DiaM>

They stepped into the library, where they had before often met. It was private, and in an afternoon seldom or ever visited by any of the family.

No sooner had they arrived there, than Theodore felt himself completely at a loss.

<DiaM>"Maria," <M>stammered he</M>, "we are to be separated. My father has sent for me."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Indeed!" <M>answered she, and the colour, which marked her as the daughter of Beauty and of Health, forsook her cheek</M>. "Oh, I shall be so lost without you!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I am going to the wars," <M>continued Theodore</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The wars!" <M>exclaimed Maria</M>, "then we shall meet no more. Those cruel, cruel wars! I wonder any one could be so wicked as to invent them."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I am going to my father," <M>proceeded Theodore</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That would be very right," <M>answered she</M>, "but might he not come here? Has he not been fighting, as I have heard Signor Salviati say, almost ever since you were born?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Not quite so long as that," <M>said Theodore</M>; "other employments have also occupied his attention."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It is a long time," <M>rejoined Maria</M>, "I hope he won't teach Theodore to do the same."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The honour of a Florentine," <M>answered the noble youth</M>, "bids me fight the enemies of Florence."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes," <M>said she</M>, "I did not mean that —- I only hoped that you would not be so long a time away."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Kind, dear Maria," <M>exclaimed Theodore</M>, "wherever I may be, the recollection of you never can forsake me. See here is the ring upon my finger, which <i>you</i> gave me. Here it is, and here it shall remain till I return to Pisa, and claim you as —---"</DiaM>

He paused. —- Maria was confused.

<DiaM>"As my bride," <M>said he, with a proud look into futurity</M>, "as the bride of an intrepid soldier."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Was not the present mutual?" <M>demanded Maria</M>. "Did you not place this upon my finger in return? Oh, Theodore, indeed I did not wish that we should ever part; but it must be so. Here then is <i>your</i> ring, and here it shall remain till you return to Pisa."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Sweet heavenly angel," <M>exclaimed Theodore</M>, "be then our vows exchanged unalterably, and be they at this moment sealed by a holy kiss!"</DiaM>

<RhetoricalQ>But what happened at this moment?</RhetoricalQ> Salviati entered. He had remembered a book, which he knew would be interesting to his friend Alberto, and came to take it from his library.

<DiaM>"Don't disturb yourselves," <M>said he, with perfect good humour</M>. "My object will be attained in a minute —- for your's I have already allotted an hour."</DiaM>

Theodore and Maria stood abashed. Salviati took his volume, and without further notice left the room.</SceneDia>

<AuthorWe>And let us do the same.</AuthorWe> <AuthorI>I like fair-play on all occasions.</AuthorI> <AuthorWE>We have witnessed the attachment between Theodore and Maria —- we see that it has every appearance of being sincere —- we believe that it is so. What right have we to pry further?</AuthorWE>

<SceneAction>The church clock struck four. Michael, like our great orators in parliament, was the first <i>upon his legs</i>. Ludovico and Theodore were not long after him. Salviati appeared at the hour he had appointed.

<DiaM>"Michael," <M>said be</M>, "is every thing ready?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No," <M>was the reply</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"What's wanting, honest fellow?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Breakfast!"</Dia>

This was soon adjusted, soon finished —- and forth proceeded Salviati in his chariot with Theodore and Ludovico, followed by Michael on his rampant horse.

<DiaM>"Friend," <M>said Ludovico to him in high spirits, as he stepped into the carriage</M>, "if you find that beast vicious summon me."</DiaM>

They had reached the frontiers -— they had climbed the mountain. Michael had already drawn forth the same leathern flask, which, sixteen years before, had in the same place afforded consolation.

<DiaM>"Let us step out," <M>said Salviati</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Thanks, thanks," <M>returned Theodore, following him</M>, "I wished it, but thought you would look upon the request as foolish."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Excuse me," <M>observed Ludovico</M>, "I have seen all Tuscany before."</DiaM> He wrapped himself in his mantle, and remained in the carriage.

Theodore, leaning on the arm of his foster-father, surveyed the prospect for some minutes without making a remark.

<DiaM>"Beautiful, most beautiful," <M>exclaimed he at length</M>. "That chain of hills —- those curving vales, through which the Arno ——--"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"True, my good Theodore," <M>interrupted Salviati</M>; "but let us not stay too long. Michael," <M>continued he, as they turned,</M> "does not native Tuscany inspire thee too?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It does," <M>answered Michael, taking the bottle of true Tuscan from his lips, and transferring it to his pouch</M>.</DiaM>

They proceeded into the wood.</SceneAction>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. III.</ChapMarker>

<ChapContents><i>An Adventure. —-- Ten to one are dangerous Odds. —-- A military Review. —-- The Meeting, and subsequent Arrangements.</i></ChapContents>

<SceneAction><DiaM>"Never!" <M>cried Ludovico, throwing open the carriage door, and leaping out with a pistol in each hand</M>.</DiaM>

The four robbers stood amazed —- Salviati and Theodore had joined him.

<DiaM>"Thou art a valiant stripling," <M>said one of them</M>, "and worthy of a better fate than that which now awaits thee."</DiaM>

The villain, seeing three determined men before him, was raising a whistle to his lips, when a shot from behind, deliberately directed by Michael, levelled him with the earth, while at the same moment Ludovico, with unerring aim, dispatched his man. The other two attempted flight, and fired at Michael as they passed; but Salviati and Theodore followed the example set them.

<DiaM>"How art thou, Michael?" <M>inquired Salviati, anxiously</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Sound," <M>answered he, coolly returning the ramrod of his re-loaded pistol</M>.</DiaM>

The robbers lay writhing in the dust, soon to end their guilty career; and the travellers, now unmolested, had resumed their seats, when suddenly they perceived themselves encircled by more than forty banditti, all accoutred like those by whom they had been previously attacked.

<DiaM>"We are lost," <M>said Salviati</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That we are not," <M>cried Ludovico and again bursting through the door stood in the midst of the confederates who were before casting a look of sorrow towards their fallen comrades, but now turned one of vengeance on their devoted victims</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Fatal, fatal will be the end of this," <M>exclaimed Salviati leaping out, followed by Theodore</M>.</DiaM>

At the same moment a bugle-horn was heard, and evidently not far from the <i>spot</i>. The robbers started —- their chief perceived the alarm, and understood it well. Distinguished in some degree by his dress, but still more by his ferocious looks, and the deference paid to him, he stept forth, and called, in a voice of thunder: <DiaQ>"Your money, and instantly, or die!"</DiaQ>

Salviati calmly presented his purse to the robber —- Ludovico calmly presented his pistol, and the robber fell.

Immediately his followers rushed forward —- inevitable death seemed to be at hand —- the bugle sounded close to them —- confusion took place among the banditti —- a troop of cavalry appeared in full march —-- the thickets could alone afford protection —- they fled. Ludovico snatched a pistol from his father's belt, and discharged it among them, not without effect.

<DiaM>"Good," <M>quoth Michael, following his example</M>.</DiaM>

The dragoons rode up, and Salviati recognized in their commander an old acquaintance.

<DiaM>"Heyday!" <M>exclaimed the officer</M>. "You here, my worthy  friend! ] thought your travels had been confined to the high road between Leghorn and Pisa. Whither bound?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"To Hungary," <M>replied Salviati</M>, "with this young cornet <M>(pointing to Theodore)</M> and my son."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Indeed!" <M>answered the officer</M>. "Then in good faith I must tell you that you seem in be possessed of too much courage, or too little information, else could you never think of journeying through this wood, dependants only on yourselves for safety. It is infested by a gang the most determined and blood-thirsty upon earth, whose infamy can only be exceeded by their cunning. The Pope has offered rewards and benedictions without number, to any one who will discover or betray the secret caverns in which the miscreants conceal themselves, but in vain. Three hundred infantry are now and every day penetrating into the recesses of the forest, while I, in obedience to order, scour the public roads. By my soul, this horde is like the Hydra. A score or two have fallen victims to my troop, yet every time I gain a sight of the rascals they appeal more numerous than before. —- I see, however, that I am detaining you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Accept my warmest thanks," <M>answered Salviati</M>. "We shall meet again, I trust, and that ere long."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Farewel for the present, then," <M>said the officer</M>. "Corporal, take three file, and escort this carriage to the border of the forest, then join us at the upper gibbet."</DiaM>

They separated.

On having returned to the carriage, Salviati expostulated with his son, pointing out how wide was the distinction between rashness and true courage; and endeavouring to convince him that but for the timely interference of the troop (which he could have no right to hope for), the lives of himself and those dearest to him, would probably have fallen a sacrifice to his determination of refusing to part with a paltry purse.

<DiaM>"Aye, but the disgrace!" <M>cried Ludovico</M>. "Saints of Heaven! shall two or three villains, nay, even two or three hundred, compel a man to acknowledge himself defeated, which they do, when he resigns what they demand?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But is not this resignation," <M>asked Salviati</M>, "preferable to death?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No," <M>returned Ludovico</M>; "in my mind death is far preferable to disgrace."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The observation is correct," <M>answered Salviati</M>, "but in our present argument it is founded upon wrong principles. Here, however, let the matter rest; for see, the fertile hills are already appearing at a distance above the wood."</DiaM>

Soon after, the horsemen took leave and nothing of material interest occurred till the travellers had almost reached Presburg.</SceneAction>

<SceneAction>On a plain, over which lay their road, a legion of hussars were employed in their manouvres. The general was stationed on a gentle rise, from which he might the better command a view of the extensive line. He was surrounded by his aids-de-camp, and various officers of distinction belonging to other corps.

The carriage passed within a few yards -- his eye accidentally caught Salviati's, and the eager fire of friendship shot from each. Alberto spurred, but at the same moment checked his horse, and immediately whispered to one of the young officers, who, gallopping to the carriage, presented the warm regards of Major General the <Cryptonym>Count de C**</Cryptonym>, with an assurance that duty alone forbade him to leave his post at present, but that in an hour he should expect to find, the travellers at his quarters. <DiaM>"Soldier," <M>concluded he, turning his horse</M>, "leap up behind this carriage, and direct the postillion to his lordship's barrack."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Needless," <M>said Michael, trotting forward</M>.</DiaM>

The appearance of the young officer was most prepossessing. They followed his directions, and took up their abode in the general's quarters.

The hour elapsed. Theodore's heart beat high with filial anticipation of the approaching interview. His foster-father paced the room with an anxiety little inferior; while Ludovico, seated in a corner, was ruminating on the martial appearance of the numerous officers who formed Alberto's staff, and still more on the commanding look, and happy lot of Alberto himself.

The sound of horses in full speed was heard; the sentinels prepared for the salute; the servants in waiting at the door stept forth; the general and his suite rode up; he threw himself from his charger; he rushed into the house. Theodore and Salviati hastened to meet him, in speechless ecstasy he pressed to his heart the offspring of affection, and the well-tried faithful friend.

<RhetoricalQ>Oh, why attempt further description?</RhetoricalQ> <RhetoricalQ>Can words convey even a feeble outline of such an interview?</RhetoricalQ> <AuthorI>I throw down my pen.</AuthorI> <Reader>He, who can truly feel, will easily supply the chasm</Reader>.</SceneAction>

Swift flew the week away, which the friends passed together. The general's cheerfulness, proverbial through the army, was not likely to suffer abatement in his present society. But once did his countenance betray symptoms of inward grief. It was when he related to Salviati the unfortunate connexion he had formed in England, since they parted, and his resolution, whenever his country's service would permit the step, to journey thither, which his friend approved.

But now to matters of more immediate moment.

<SceneDia><DiaM>"I shall fill it up as I please," <M>said Alberto jocosely</M>, "so away with your objections, for I'll not listen to another."</DiaM>

He was sitting at table, opposite to Salviati, talking over occurrences of former days, and arranging plans for the future. Before him lay the two vacant commissions in his own favourite Fifth Regiment of Hussars. Theodore's name was already inserted in one. The present discussion respected Ludovico; and many were the arguments which the general had used, before he could prevail upon his friend to sanction the measure. Theodore had not been unmindful of his promise, but had strongly solicited his father to intercede that he and Ludovico might not be separated.

<DiaM>"The boy must follow the bent of his genius," <M>added Alberto</M>. -- "I know all about it. —- I see plainly what the dog is. 'Sblood, fire, and thunder! why, he's as fit to live with your placid Florentines as a salamander among the bears in Greenland."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Well, well," <M>said Salviati</M>, "you will have it so."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"To be sure I will," <M>rejoined Alberto, immediately filling the commission, and then ringing</M>.</DiaM>

Michael entered.

<Dia>"Are the young men within?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Yes."</Dia>

<Dia>"Send them hither."</Dia>

<Dia>"Engaged."</Dia>

<Dia>"How so? With what?"</Dia>

<Dia>"The armoury."</Dia>

<Dia>"Right —- just as it should he. Here Michael —- this to my son —- this to Cornet Salviati."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Good," <M>said Michael, and left the room</M>.</DiaM></SceneDia>

<RhetoricalQ>And now, who so happy as Ludovico?</RhetoricalQ> He had gained the very object which his glowing mind had looked upon as the first, the most desirable step towards the renown which he coveted.

Letters demanded the return of Salviati; and on the very day preceding his departure, the count received marching orders. Mournful presages seemed to oppose the spirits of the worthy merchant; but Alberto laughed at them.

<SpeechInsert>"Nonsense!" <M>exclaimed he</M>. "Our sons will rise in the army, and prove the boast of our old age. 'Sblood, batteries, and bombshells! I was melancholy too, when I left you, but what am I now? Cheer up —- your hand! Lift high the glass! You too, young hussars —- Conrad, Theodore, Ludovico! May we meet our enemies face to face in a week, and our friends at Pisa in a year!"</SpeechInsert>

<AuthorWe>We have had partings enough</AuthorWe>, <Reader>reader</Reader> —- so Salviati is gone, and we are now marching with the legion. But first, <Reader>let me more nearly introduce to you</Reader> this young Conrad, the Lieutenant, who, <Reader>as you remember</Reader>, took Alberto's message to the carriage. <Backstory>The general, in imitation of Count X-- (through whose penetration he had been so rapidly and properly advanced, as <AuthorWe>we</AuthorWe> have before seen) had an eye ever wandering in search of merit. In the youth now spoken of, he had discovered and cherished it.

<SpeechInsert>"From my extensive duty," <M>said he, to Theodore and Ludovico</M>, "I cannot be always at hand to assist you with my advice. Look on Conrad as your military tutor, and you will both soon learn to look upon him as your private friend."</SpeechInsert>

Conrad was by birth a Bohemian -— but slenderly gifted by the blind goddess, but of amiable disposition, strict integrity, and undeniable valour. A young man, in whose mind gratitude towards his patron was indelibly implanted; and who had never been known to assume a look bordering on displeasure or chagrin but once, which was when the count, advancing towards him after a severe battle, said in a voice purposely loud, <SpeechInsert>"To you, Sir, I am this day indebted for my life."</SpeechInsert></Backstory>

Here <AuthorWe>we must</AuthorWe> for the present take leave of the warriors. Suffice it to say in brief that during three campaigns, they shared the danger and glory of the field. Alberto, with heartfelt pleasure, saw the dauntless resolution with which his three favourites endeavoured to acquire practical knowledge in their profession —- the cheerfulness with which, when necessary, they yielded to every privation. Victory succeeded victory. Immortal fame appeared to crown the Imperial Eagle.

<ChapContents><i>The Head of the Family, and his Private Secretary. —-- Gracious condescension. —-- One Fox may scent the Haunts of another. —-- A Love-Letter —-- its Natural Consequences.</i></ChapContents>

It should be recollected that Alberto was the younger brother of the Marquis de C**, who enjoyed by inheritance immense estates in Tuscany. The Grand Duke, as a member of the imperial family, was, in these perilous times, almost always in the Austrian camp or cabinet. His dominions were consequently under the direction of some Florentine nobleman, appointed for that purpose, and assuming vice-regal importance. <RhetoricalQ>Who could seem, in his eyes, by property and consequence, so fit for the station of his representative as the marquis? Yet, alas, who in reality could have been less fit for it? Educated in the lap of luxury and flattery, by a weak doting mother, and a submissive crafty priest, who humoured and sanctioned his every wish —- what was to be expected of such a man, when, at the age of twenty-one, he found himself the first grandee in the land?</RhetoricalQ>

For several years had he now oppressed his hapless country. Taxes and burthens annually increased to swell his coffers, that with the greater pomp he might support his dignified situation, that with the more unbridled licentiousness he might pass his time in revelry, and follow his infamous propensities. No two men on earth could he more opposite in character than he end his exalted brother —- the one by birth opulent, and of high rank, who never had been known to do a good action —- the other a count, and a general through his individual merit. The marquis could boast of his conquests for he was a man of insinuating manners, and finished <i>politesse</i> —- but Alberto's victories were those of a brave soldier and an honest man —- his brother's were the mean triumphs of successful villainy over deluded innocence.

Families, which had for centuries been resident in Tuscany, were now seen to emigrate: this had, however, no effect on the voluptuary. His parasites were ever ready with the incense of flattery, and the hardened wretch persisted in his measures.

<SceneFragment>He had a palace at Pisa; and here it was that he first observed Amelia walking on the terrace. She had now attained, her eighteenth year —- her face and form were loveliness itself. He was struck as she passed, and, with his eye following her steps, demanded who she was.

<<DiaM>"My lord," <M>replied his Secretary Cosmo</M>, "her name is Salviati. She is the daughter of a wealthy merchant, who retires hither occasionally from Leghorn."</DiaM>

The minions of the court exchanged smile, for well they knew that her fate was at this moment decided.

<DiaM>"Enough!" <M>observed the marquis</M>, "let us proceed. Cosmo, attend me in my cabinet to-night."</DiaM></SceneFragment>

<SceneDia>The next morning Salviati was informed by the secretary, at an early hour, that his excellency the marquis intended to honour him with a call, as he proceeded to hunt in the adjoining forest.

<DiaM>"Indeed!" <M>exclaimed Salviati</M>. "To what do I owe this unlooked for and unmerited distinction? I never before was ever personally introduced to his lordship. 'Tis true, I know his noble brother well. Perhaps the visit bears reference to him. If so ——--"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I believe not," <M>interrupted Cosmo</M>: "I conjecture that it bears reference to a subject which is much dearer to his heart."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Than his brother!" <M>exclaimed Salviati</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Even so," <M>replied the courtier with a courtier's smile</M>. "His lordship has views of a nature which will be still more welcome to you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Impossible!" <M>cried the unsuspecting merchant</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, pardon me, good Signor," <M>proceeded Cosmo</M>; "it seems you understand me not. I have the proud felicity of ranking high in the confidence of his lordship. What if I tell you that his intentions descend even to a family alliance?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Descend! Alliance! You speak in parables," <M>said Salviati</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Let me be explicit then," <M>returned the fawning sycophant</M>. "Some three weeks since, or perhaps a month, the marquis by mere accident beheld your amiable daughter on the public terrace."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Impossible!" <M>interrupted Salviati</M>, "she was, till within the last three days, at a considerable distance."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have merely mistaken the place, then," <M>answered Cosmo</M>, "and now I recollect it was at some distance from Pisa that the marquis first saw her."</DiaM>

Salviati eyed him firmly, but with calm demeanour.

<DiaM>"Proceed Signor," <M>said he</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"To behold her," <M>continued the secretary</M>, "was to adore her. Long as I have known his lordship, never have I seen him thus affected. Day by day he summons me —- for hours we sit together, and not a word can escape him, but of Amelia Salviati. Tell me, friend, he says, tell me, what is our Venus de Medici now -- Those angelic features! that bewitching figure! that transcendant grace in every movement! and above all, the bashful look, unconscious of perfection! that timid fascinating look, which appertains to purity alone! Oh, Cosmo, I could fancy her a being sent to restrain my wandering thoughts, and teach me constancy. Oh, were our holy church to make her the partner of my bed, then, then indeed, should the world learn, which of the different characters I bear most properly belongs to me."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Signor," <M>said the no longer unsuspecting merchant, who had never heard but <i>one</i> character of the marquis</M>, "you much amaze me. And this is the object of his lordship's visit?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Hold, I don't say that," <M>answered Cosmo</M>. "His lordship merely commanded me to announce his visit. I have no authority from him to prepare you thus —- I do it from friendship."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And yet," <M>retorted Salviati</M>, "it does not occur to me, Signor, that I ever had the honour of seeing you before. A visit from his excellency must, however, be considered by me as a compliment, and condescension."</DiaM>

The secretary <ArrivalDeparture>retired bowing</ArrivalDeparture>, and requesting that Salviati would do him the justice to believe that no one occupied a higher situation in his regard.

<DiaM>"There is something in all this which bodes no good," murmured the good merchant to himself, while ruminating on the strange occurrence. The libertine has cast an eye upon my daughter, and his minion is sent hither to hoodwink me. But softly, my lord marquis, you yourself shall be for once outwitted. You shall not to-day even see Amelia; and if my car can provide against it, without cruelty to her, you shall never see her more."</DiaM></SceneDia>

He proceeded to make the arrangement necessary for his purpose, and without further explanation to his daughter, which might perhaps only sow the seeds of disquiet in her young bosom, he requested that, till summoned by himself, she would continue in her chamber.

<SceneDia>Ere long the marquis appeared with a splendid retinue. He alighted, and, together with his suite, was shewn into the saloon. Salviati immediately appeared, and humbly bade him welcome.

<DiaM>"Friend of my brother," <M>replied the hypocrite</M>, "I lament that affairs of state, which daily multiply upon me, have so long prevented an acquaintance between us. But why not come to court?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"My lord," <M>answered the merchant</M>, "I much doubt whether the court would suit my turn for retirement; besides which, I have been often told that your lordship had prohibited the appearance of any one there unless of noble origin, which I am not."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No rule without an exception," <M>answered the marquis, taking his hand with an air of familiar condescension.</M> "To see you will at all times give pleasure. You have a daughter too, I understand, who would (if I might judge from a mere transient view) make beauty more in fashion among at Florence. She should be introduced."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, by all means!" <M>cried Cosmo</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"My daughter," <M>replied Salviati with gravity</M>, "has no desire for such a change, nor has her father."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But, my good Signor," <M>answered the marquis</M>, "you should consider the probable result."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I do," <M>said the merchant</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You should look forward," <M>continued his excellency</M>, "to the happy establishment of your family in life."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Happiness dwells not in cities," <M>returned Salviati</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But it is in cities chiefly," <M>preceded the marquis</M>, "that young women make their fortunes."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Hers is already made, my lord," <M>said her father</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nay, Signor, understand me," <M>observed the libertine</M>. "I mean as to connexion. Beautiful and accomplished as she is, even a noble of the highest rank might ——--"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Seduce my child," <M>interrupted Salviati</M>: "I know it —- nothing more common."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"How!" <M>exclaimed the arch-hypocrite with perfect mildness</M>, "Can you have formed such notions of the court? I grant that in great cities the profligate are often to be found; but do you never see them in the country?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Sometimes," <M>replied Salviati with a distant and respectful bow</M>.</DiaM>

The marquis understood him, but it did not suit his purpose to appear as if he did.

<DiaM>"The fair signora," <M>proceeded he, turning the conversation with an assumed air of indifference</M> -- "shall we not have the gratification of seeing her?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I am sorry, my lord," <M>said her father</M>, "that she cannot appear —- she is somewhat indisposed."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It hurts me much," <M>answered the marquis</M>. "Only a trifling influenza, I hope? —- Well, I shall be more fortunate when chance brings me this way again. Meanwhile, I hope to know you better, my good friend. Do me the honpur of dining at the palace to-day."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Excuse me, my lord," <M>replied Salviati</M>, "my mercantile affairs demand my presence."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Your excellency!" <M>said Cosmo, stepping forward and pointing to the window</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"True," <M>returned the marquis</M>, "I perceive the sun is high. I had almost forgotten the chace, in conversation with this worthy man. Farewel. Be pleased to present my respectful wishes for the recovery of the fair signora. When I can be of any use to you, command me."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Your lordship has done me much honour."</Dia>

The unwelcome guests took their departure, and Salviati wandered into his garden, there coolly to determine on the surest means of counteracting the plot which these shallow foplings had so palpably betrayed.</SceneDia>

<RhetoricalQ>Alas! who can look into futurity?</RhetoricalQ> Fatal to himself were the resolutions at this hour formed by Salviati. Fatal to himself were the resolutions at this hour formed by the marquis.

It was the ultimate determination of her father, that Amelia should be placed under the protection of her aunt, whom she often visited, and who lived in genteel but not ostentatious style at Leghorn, where indeed Salviati passed far the greater portion of his time. He explained every circumstance to his sister, but still carefully withheld all information from Amelia, knowing full well that female <i>virtue</i> is a frail bark, which, during the years of inexperience, is too often engulphed by that dangerous quicksand, female <i>vanity</i>. To tell her that the first grandee of Tuscany was her adorer, and then to tell her that she must not listen to him, was, in the honest merchant's mind, an experiment of folly and of peril: better that she should for ever remain ignorant of what never could be brought to an honourable issue.

<SceneFragment>But the marquis was not to be deterred from his purpose by trifling difficulties; for in pursuits of this nature he had always been ultimately successful. Cosmo was employed, as usual, to wait upon the aunt, and endeavour to lull all suspicions. He found her, however, well prepared for his reception, and the proffered visit of his excellency, when she next meant to receive company, was politely but coldly declined.

<DiaM>"The company which frequents my house," <M>said she</M>, "would be unfit for his lordship's society. Unpleasant rumours too might be the consequence, and these I must avoid both for my own sake, and that of my relatives. I wish this, Signor, to be conveyed to the marquis in the language of deference and respect due to his exalted station, and here beg leave to close the discussion."</DiaM>

With these words she rose from her chair. <FIDambig>What could the secretary do? Go he must</FIDambig> —- but before he quitted the house, he contrived to whisper into the ear of a footman, whose looks seemed to indicate that he would not whisper in vain.

<DiaM>"Call at the Great Hotel to-night," <M>said he</M>, "at nine o'clock, and your fortune is made."</DiaM>

A sly nod convinced him that his hint was taken, and at the appointed hour the wretch attended. He received a liberal present and assurances of many more, with instructions how to act his part in the plot, which was laid against the chastity of Amelia, and the precautions of her family.</SceneFragment>

<SceneFragment>The impatience of the marquis admitted but of short delay. A few days after, <Trigger>as Amelia had just</Trigger> stepped down stairs, and was crossing the hall, her attention was arrested by a servant in gay livery, who passed her, with Paulo, the footman of her aunt. His air seemed far above his situation, and as he walked forward, he bowed with a look of mingled admiration and respect. For the moment she thought no more of this; but Paulo coming ere long into the breakfast-room, she asked with indifference who the tall stranger was.

Paulo looked round to be certain that his mistress was not near, and then staid, in a low tone of voice, <DiaQ>"The highest man in the state, Signora, yet the humblest of your admirers. I told the marquis that his only chance of seeing you was by attending early; as you always came down stairs before my lady. This letter will explain the rest; but his excellency hopes that you will, even if cruel, not expose a man of honour to the derision of the illiberal."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"That I shall never do," <M>answered she</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"For in a case," <M>proceeded the footman</M>, "where the regent of the grand duchy is concerned, delicacy makes it necessary to keep a secret of this nature even from the nearest relations."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"As far as my feelings of propriety will allow it," <M>returned Amelia</M>, "I shall do nothing which can be unpleasant to the feelings of a gentleman. But hark! My aunt ----"</DiaM>

Paulo, as she entered the room, appeared to be arranging the breakfast table. Amelia hid the letter in her bosom; for, exclusive of the request which had been mentioned, old maids are seldom fixed upon to be the confidants of young ones.</SceneFragment>

<SceneReadingWriting><Graft>No sooner</Graft> could she find an excuse for quitting the apartment, than she hastened to her own. A secret tremor crept through her veins as she drew forth the letter —- she knew not what it meant. In her "mind's eye" she again beheld the handsome servant —- <Monologue>"for that he is handsome," <M>said she</M>, "who can deny?"</Monologue> —- She blushed —- she broke the seal with a fluttering heart, and read:

<QuotedText>Adored Signora!
A captive of your beauty, who glories in his chains, can no longer conceal the passion which for some months has preyed upon his spirits, and robbed him of repose. Unconscious as you are of that perfection which exalts you above all your sex, it is possible and even probable that you have not, in your walks, distinguished the humble follower of your footsteps, through the various disguises which his rank has compelled him to assume. By means of a servant in the family, I hope to-morrow morning I may at least be allowed to see you for a moment. And must this moment be the only one? Can frigid cruelty inhabit the gentle bosom of Amelia?
Will you treat with scorn the ardent affection of an honourable lover? Will you, after all the tears, and sighs, and sleepless nights, which you have innocently caused me —- will you, can you refuse me the gratification of an interview? Ah no! compassion towards one, who never, till he saw you, felt the force of love, will not allow you to deny me. No danger can ensue. Be the hour fixed by yourself —- be your servant, or any friend, your companion; be the place of meeting close to your home, in the pavilion, to which Paulo will supply me with access. He too will convey to me your answer.
Divine Amelia, let it be favourable. Crush not the humblest of your slaves —- drive not to distraction
Your's while he shall breath
DE C**.
Marquis and Regent of the Grand Duchy.</QuotedText>

Amelia sunk into a chair —- contending emotions shook her frame. To admit the addresses of a man whom she had scarcely seen —- to appoint an assignation with him, unknown to her relatives -— duty and female diffidence forbade it. But then, to be adored by the first nobleman of Florence -— to have the marquis, and regent of the Grand Duchy suing for her hand! —- <Reader>Tell me, fair reader, would there not have been something grateful to your bosom in all this?</Reader></SceneReadingWriting>

<FIDambig>But Flora must, of course, be consulted</FIDambig>; <RhetoricalQ>for who so capable of managing these matters as a lady's maid?</RhetoricalQ> Flora had already received her instructions, and a purse through Paulo; so her advice may be easily guessed.

A few more <i>ifs</i> and <i>buts</i>, and struggles between propriety and inclination on the part of Amelia -— a host of arguments, persuasions, and <DiaOther>"Only think how every one will envy you,"</DiaOther> on the part of Flora —- the assignation is determined on.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. V.</ChapMarker>

<ChapContents><i>Deception! —-- Duel! --- Death!</i></ChapContents>

<SceneFragment>The appointed time arrived -— it was an hour before Salviati's sister was wont to rise. Amelia repaired with Flora to the pavilion, and had not yet crossed the threshold, <Trigger>when</Trigger> the door communicating with the street was opened, and, hastily throwing off his mantle, at her feet knelt the marquis.

It is true that his lordship was the elder brother of Alberto, and the uncle of Theodore. It may, therefore, be supposed that his appearance would border on the <i>antique</i> —- but the contrary was the case. Alberto entered the army, when nineteen years old, and his had now reached the same age. The marquis was not yet forty; and no one better knew how to make the most of his personal attractions. On this occasion he wore a habit of costly magnificence, and the air, with which he now gazed at Amelia, was that of an enthusiastic idolater.

<DiaM>"May I believe my disordered senses?" <M>exclaimed he</M>. "Do I indeed lie at the feet of Amelia? Oh bliss ineffable!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Indeed, my lord," <M>returned the blushing maid</M>, "you much confuse me. Rise, I beseech you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Never, oh never!" <M>cried the marquis</M>, "till with that trembling and bewitching accent you tell me I may hope."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Pardon me, my lord," <M>answered he</M>, "this is too much. Reflect how little we as yet know each other."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"True! true!" <M>replied the hypocrite</M>. "Forgive —- forget the rash request which love, riding on the wings of anticipation, had suggested. I obey -- I rise, trusting that Amelia will at least take a seat, and listen to my faithful vows."</DiaM>

He led her to a chair, and proceeded.

<AuthorI>But why should I do this?</AuthorI> Almost every one knows how interviews of this nature are conducted —- almost every one knows that they never end till another is agreed upon.</SceneFragment>

Salviati was right. Amelia's vanity was excited by the attentions of the marquis: his insinuating address, gradually found its way to her heart —- his well-disguised flattery worked on her credulous nature —- and it was not long before he found himself complete master of her affections. He often talked of their approaching marriage, and stated that he was making arrangements for Salviati to be properly acquainted with their mutual attachment, for on this point she constantly dwelt.

<SpeechInsert>You may think, my dear Amelia," <M>said he one day</M>, "that it might have been done sooner; but sure I am, the ardour of my attachment must shew how unwillingly I submit to any delay which even necessity creates. I need not tell you how apt detraction is to aim her dart at those who are most elevated in society. She has not missed me. Slanderers have traduced my character in the opinion of your upright parent. By time only, and the adoption et proper measures, can I dispel the mist which at present clouds his judgment."</SpeechInsert>

Such were the excuses which the villain brought forward at intervals, when they best suited the diabolical purpose he had in view. The presence of Flora had already been dispensed with at their meetings, which were far more frequent than at first; and the marquis had seemed, for so many months, to have turned his attentions another way, that suspicion ceased to occupy the minds of Salviati and his sister.

It was spring. The sun shot his genial rays from a sky the most serene; the olive, the myrtle, and the orange-tree were wafted by a gentle zephyr; the birds were carolling on every branch; the flowers spread a perfume through the atmosphere. Love seemed to be felt —- Love seemed to be inspired by universal nature. Amelia gave way to the soft sensations which the surrounding objects caused -- her hand had been for some time locked in that of the marquis -- her burning lips had repeatedly been pressed by his —- her tumultuous heart had beat against her lover's. The opportunity, so long anticipated by the miscreant, was arrived —- Amelia's innocence was lost for ever.

<Apostrophe>Unfortunate deluded fair one! was there then no guardian angel near, to protect thee from this monster? Did no kind genius whisper through the breeze "Beware, Amelia?" Did no compassionate sea-nymph raise her head above the waves, which washed the base of yonder pavilion, and call, "The tempter is sitting at thy side?" -- Alas!-- no. —- All animated creation seemed to unite against thee. Devoid of guile thyself, far was it from thy generous nature to suspect it in another. Oh, that <AuthorI>my pen</AuthorI> could erase the record of thy fate —- but it may not be! The tear of genuine compassion drops upon thy wrongs —- accept the heart-felt tribute, and repose in peace.</Apostrophe>

<SceneFragment>Triumphantly the marquis summoned Cosmo to his cabinet —- a Satanic smile proclaimed the ruin of his devoted victim.

<DiaM>"I see how it is," <M>observed the secretary</M>. "I congratulate your lordship."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You are right," <M>answered the marquis</M>. "This day has made Amelia mine. The tables now are turned, and henceforth our secret meetings must be solicited by her."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Of course," <M>returned Cosmo</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But the little prude in the city here?" <M>enquired his employer</M>. "How do you proceed as to her?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Slowly." <M>answered the infamous pander</M>, "but not on that account the less securely. In about a week I shall have procured access for your lordship. Her governante is already won."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That is a giant's stride," <M>exclaimed the marquis</M>. "Ever while you live, gain over the duenna, or my lady's maid, and I laugh at the measures which the most subtle relative can take against me."</DiaM></SceneFragment>

And poor Amelia? She wandered every morning to the pavilion. The marquis had promised that in three days at furthest he would return from Florence —- yet still he came not. A week elapsed —- yet still he came not. <SceneFragment>She reflected more and more upon the cause of his continued absence —- doubts crept into her mind —- suspicions followed them —- <Trigger>till at length</Trigger> the whole horrors of her situation lay open to her view. With tears of bitter anguish and severe repentance, she threw herself into the arms of her aunt, and confessed her weakness.

The virtuous matron drew back a step —- but could she do more? On her neck hung the sobbing girl, whose infantile prattle had so often interested her in former days, and who, till this moment had done nothing to displease her.

<DiaM>"Let us sit down, Amelia," <M>said she</M> —- "let me reflect —- you have surprised, and hurt me much."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, do not, do not abandon me!" <M>exclaimed her unhappy niece</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Never!" <M>answered she, without hesitation.</M> "But your dear father! -- I must not, dare not, conceal the fatal tidings from him. What will he feel?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Alas!" <M>cried Amelia</M>, "the very thought almost drives me to distraction. The best, the kindest parent!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That he has been indeed," <M>returned is sister</M>, "and now, when he was looking forward to his reward in seeing you well settled —- Oh Amelia, what have you done?"</DiaM>

She again received the trembling penitent into her embrace, and endeavoured to console her.</SceneFragment>

<SceneQuasi>Speechless with horror stood Salviati, when he had perused the letter just received from his sister. The servant asked if any answer would be sent —- he saw -- heard not. The vengeance of an injured father was brooding in his soul, and occupied his every thought. He seized his pen, and in terms of glowing indignation offered to the marquis a choice of immediate marriage with his daughter, or a meeting, which would satisfy his injured honour.</SceneQuasi> For two days this letter was unanswered, during which Salviati had leisure more coolly to reflect upon the unfortunate event. If the marquis should accede to either of his proposals, all was right —- if not, a plan had occurred to him by which he felt certain to attain his end.

<SceneReadingWriting>The answer came —- it was worded as follows:

<QuotedText>"I am commanded by his excellency the Marquis de C**, to state, that the conviction of your labouring under the pressure of mental derangement, when you wrote the daring letter which he has received, can alone induce him not to commit you to prison, and subject you to the punishment which the law inflicts on those who threaten the life of His Imperial Highness the Grand Duke's Representative. Unless your penitence be proved by future silence, this punishment yet awaits you.
COSMO.
Secretary to the Regent."</QuotedText>

<Monologue>"'Tis well, 'tis well!" <M>cried Salviati, taking his hat</M>. "Now to my daughter!"</Monologue></SceneReadingWriting>

<SceneFragment>Amelia was resting her head upon her hand, the silent prey of penitent dejection. On the opposite side sat her aunt, inwardly wondering at the cause of Salviati's absence. The door was suddenly thrown open, and he entered. Amelia turned, and with a loud shriek fell from her chair. Both flew to her aid, and bore her to the sofa. Proper remedies were instantly applied -- ere long the injured sufferer raised her eyes, and again beheld the parent, whose good advice she had in an evil hour, so fatally forgotten, whose fostering care she had so ill requited. Yet his features were devoid of sternness —- it was <QuotedLit>"a countenance more in sorrow than in anger."</QuotedLit>

<DiaM>"Fear not, Amelia," <M>said he, in a tone of tenderness</M>, "I come not to upbraid, but to avenge thee. Obey what I direct, and not a syllable, bordering on reproach, shall now, or ever, escape my lips."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, you are too good!" <M>exclaimed she</M>. "Demand of your wretched daughter any thing you will."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Enough!" <M>answered he</M>. "Summon your strength and resolution; let my arm support you; take this pen and write as I shall dictate."</DiaM>

Amelia obeyed. With quivering hand she addressed the marquis —- lamented in terms of innocent affection how much his continued absence had distressed her —- appeared however, not to suppose but that unexpected avocations were the cause —- besought him by their mutual love, not to make her endure further misery —- but earnestly and ardently implored that he would the next morning meet her at the usual time and place.</SceneFragment>

In the course of the day, Amelia by her father's instruction, privately commissioned Paulo (whom she confessed to have been thus employed before) to deliver the letter; and it safely reached its destination —- for Paulo had always found it suit his purpose to convey the dispatches faithfully, his lordship being on such occasions most liberal in his rewards.

<SpeechInsert>"Another hour of bliss awaits me," <M>said he</M>. "Till my little prude is rendered more tractable by Cosmo I might as well enjoy it."</SpeechInsert>

<SceneAction>The period arrived: he entered privately as before, and looked around for Amelia; but at this moment Salviati sprang into the pavilion, secured the door towards the street, and placing his back against it, exclaimed, <DiaQ>"Villain, thou escapest me not. Draw, and defend thy life."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"What!" <M>said the marquis, endeavouring to conceal his confusion and alarm under a look of menace and authority</M>, "I hold no wars with maniacs. Retire, Signor, or dread my power."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I defy thee and thy power," <M>cried Salviati</M>. "Thou hast reached the goal of thine abandoned career. Draw, coward! or by my wrongs I'll plunge this sword into thine undefended breast."</DiaM>

The determined eye of Salviati shot terror and dismay into the heart of the miscreant; but there was now no choice —- the weapon was already raised to dispatch him.

<DiaM>"Nay then," <M>said he, reluctantly drawing forth his sword</M> ----</DiaM>

Salviati made the attack with furious vehemence —- death glittered on his blade —- destruction flashed from his eye. The marquis parried feebly -- conscious infamy palsied his arm, and quenched the little spark of courage he possessed. Twice was Salviati's sword plunged into his body —- he fell.

<DiaM>"We are revenged, my child, we are revenged," <M>cried the exulting merchant as he rushed into the room where his sister and daughter were sitting</M>.</DiaM> His sword, reeking with the blood of the marquis, was still in his hand.

<Exclamation>Rash, inconsiderate father!</Exclamation> <RhetoricalQ>was it possible that the delicate frame of Amelia, already undermined by the perfidy, of him on whom she doted, and by unceasing remorse, could endure a spectacle like this?</RhetoricalQ> —- <Exclamation>Ah! no.</Exclamation> Full well she knew, from the letter she had written what a tragedy was acting —- full certainly she felt that she too should be included in the catastrophe. Broken-hearted, and bowed down with sorrow, she awaited the result. Salviati entered as described —- and lifeless, she sunk upon the floor, like a fair lily crushed by the storm, never to rise again.</SceneAction>

<Exclamation>Oh, what were the sensations of her hapless parent, when the exultation of revenge subsided!</Exclamation> In vain did his sister press him to fly —- in vain did she point out that inevitable destruction awaited him —- he courted it. The infamy brought upon his house had been washed off -— but his darling daughter was no more. To the protection of Heaven and his own undaunted soul he confided Ludovico, and death was now most welcome.

Orders were given by his sister that the body of the marquis might be removed; but to her great astonishment the servants did not find it in the pavilion. Traces of blood were left upon the floor, they said, and no further discovery could they make.

A report also now prevailed through the town, that the marquis had been conveyed on a litter to the Great Hotel, having been severely wounded by some unknown person.

This needs little explanation. Cosmo, finding that the lovers remained together much longer than usual, ventured to give a hint that danger might ensue, by tapping at the door through which his lordship always entered. In a feeble voice, the marquis called to him by name. He burst the lock, and seeing what had happened, ran for assistance.

The surgeons who examined the wounds reported that the weapon, by which they were occasioned, had almost miraculously missed every vital part, and that the danger, if any, consisted in his lordship's exhausted state from loss of blood. His natural strength of constitution soon began to operate against this, and he was at length, to the universal regret of the duchy, declared by the public bulletin to be in a state of convalescence.

No sooner did he feel a gradual return of strength, than his malignant soul was bent on the destruction of his enemy, which he first thought of bringing about by public trial; but this plan was soon dismissed, for Salviati's connexions were extensive, and no one more universally beloved. The marquis felt that such was far from being his own case. The vexatious burthens under which every class the community had so long laboured, were now beginning to excite a spirit of discontent in more than one part of Tuscany which might be stated to border on rebellion. By running the risk of public exposure he would only be encouraging this tendency —- besides, a more easy and expeditious mode of attaining his end was always in his power, and often resorted to.

One night, Salviati's country seat at Pisa was discovered to be in a blaze at different quarters. The domestics gave the alarm —- every one ran towards the point at which escape seemed most probable; and in the general confusion the unfortunate merchant was dispatched by the hands of bravoes, hired for that purpose. His body was consumed by the flames, and buried in the ruins of his villa.

<Exclamation>Fountain of justice!</Exclamation> <RhetoricalQ>was this inhuman monster still allowed to breathe the vital air? Was not the thunderbolt of heavenly wrath launched forth to blast him?</RhetoricalQ>...... But <AuthorI>let me not</AuthorI> arraign thy wise inscrutable decrees. It was thy will that the measure of his crimes should be filled even to the brim, that the more terrible might be his death, the more awful his example.
