<ChapTitle>Introduction.</ChapTitle>

<ChPortrait><ChNameIntro>CHARLES STANLY,</ChNameIntro> at the age of twenty-three, excited universal admiration. Elegant in his address,faultless in his figure, which was rather above the middling height, and a handsome face, made him an object of interest with the younger part of the opposite sex. By a happy versatility of disposition, he could adopt his conversation to the society he was in; and though all animation and mirth, when with those of his own years, yet, when

#2#

in company with his elders, he could easily assume a grave and respectful deportment. No wonder that, by means of these insinuating qualities, Charles Stanly should become a favorite with all who knew him.

Though far from being of a studious disposition, Stanly was by no means uninformed; he read indeed but little; but having a good memory, retained all he read. Mankind he had made his chief study, and from that circumstance was become an adept in the art of pleasing; with the fair sex, particularly, he seldom failed, for he well knew the powerful and persuasive charms of flattery, and how great was its influence on a female breast; but then he always expressed himself in that delicate, refined language, which never failed to carry with it the semblance of truth and sincerity.

#3#


Thus he became early accustomed to dissimulation; for as he was a great admirer of the fair, he continually employed his seducing talents to gain their affections.

In Charles Stanly the pen has to pourtray a singular character. No man could have a more refined, more exalted, sense of religion, than himself; and yet no man could conduct himself more widely from the precepts it inculcated. His bosom would glow with delight when listening to the detail of a virtuous act, and he would feel unhappy that it was not himself who had performed it; yet,the next hour he would, perhaps, be engaged in scenes of dissipation and wickedness; his good genius no longer swayed his mind, but left it to the dominion of evil spirits: then, when the moment of reflection came, and to him they often came, he

#4#

would start with horror at the depravity of his actions, resolve to amend; and yet, perhaps, e'er that week had elapsed, all those resolutions would vanish in some new pursuit of pleasure.

He was, in truth, a most dangerous character to be in the world, gifted with such qualifications for pleasing, and employing them as he did.

His fortune was moderate, but when added to his military income, for Stanly bore a commission in the army, was sufficient to maintain a genteel establishment, and to answer the frequent demands which were made on his purse, either for good or bad purposes. For Stanly’s heart would, melt at a tale of woe, and his hand was ever open to afford relief, while the same readiness was attendant on his purchasing the ready smile of the aban-

doned prostitute, and in bringing about the dark plans of female seduction.</ChPortrait>

The time this history commences was when Stanly first became acquainted with <ChPortrait><ChNameIntro>Miss Emily Henderson:</ChNameIntro> having been introduced to her at the house of a friend. She had just made her <i>entrée</i> in the fashionable world, having left a well-known boarding-school at the west end of the town, where her education had been rendered as complete as the taste of the modern times permitted; that is, she had learned to dress to the greatest advantage, to dance, to play on the piano, on which indeed she performed to admiration, for music was her greatest delight; these, with a little French, constituted the whole of her studies and accomplishments; unless indeed

#6#

her being deeply read in romances can be considered as one.

Nature had been lavish in her endeavors to form in Emily a perfect model of beauty; she was tall and elegantly made, the rose of health tinged her downy cheeks, where the smiling dimples delighted the gaze; her lovely eyes darted their expressive glances through her silken eyelashes, her beautiful dark glossy ringlets sported over her forehead, and her long tresses were disposed of according to the fickle fashion of the day.

Emily was as yet too young to have any decided character; she was, however, generous, benevolent, and compassionate; and unfortunately for her, owing to her perfect ignorance of the world in which she now for the first time appeared, was of an unsuspicious, liberal disposition. Her fondness for

#7#

that engaging species of literature had made her somewhat romantic in her, ideas, and more than once in her dreams she had imagined herself rescued from some fierce oppressor’s power by a valorous knight, who breathed in her delighted ears those tender expressions, which she had so often pondered over with rapture.

Such reading had awpke in her bosom tender ideas, and her heart gradually became the seat of sensibility; she had a larger share of good sense and reflection than was common at her years; but they were not able to eradicate many impressions, which she had received in her more infantine days, from the ill-assorted volumes she had perused.</ChPortrait>

Such was Emily Henderson at the time she left the fashionable seminar of youth, and came to her father’s

#8#

house in Harley street.- he had lost her mother, when young; and her father had married again; in consequence of which he had a further increase to his family of a son and daughter, who where then at school.

Mrs. Henderson, extravagantly fond of her own children, could not think, without emotions of regret and disappointment, that Emily would share the largest portion of her husband’s fortune at his decease. From that reason alone her aversion to her commenced, and which gradually increased into an irreconcilable hatred.

Mr. Henderson was what the world terms a good-natured man; that is, he was a character which the designing could easily influence and form to their own purposes. For the sake of quiet at home he allowed his wife to have

#9#

her own way, and this liberty she, in process of time, converted into an absolute right; and her husband became a mere cypher in his family.

Owing to Mrs. Henderson’s dislike, Emily was kept as long at her boarding school as she could with any propriety; but she was at last obliged to listen to the remonstrances of her husband to permit her to leave it; for he was much attached to his daughter, and which perhaps the conduct of his second wife served to increase, by continually reminding him of the happiness he enjoyed with Emily’s mother, of whom he was very fond.

Such was Emily Henderson, and such her unpleasant situation at home, when Stanly, became acquainted with her.

To describe the sensations of his bosom, when he gazed on her beau-

#10#

ties, would be difficult indeed; for the lovely form before him possessed all those charms which he had long wished to find concentred in one person, he could not resist such a sweet temptation of indulging his visual senses, and his eyes were fixed in impassioned, glances on her; dangerous indeed vas that indulgence, since it deeply implanted in his bosom the recollection of her charms.

Just emerged from the seclusion of her boarding school, Emily, unknowing of the ways of the world, received the attentions of Stanly with unfeigned delight, his form captivated, and his conversation delighted her, how indeed could it be otherwise, since herself was the theme of his discourse, and her beauties and attractions the subject hs seemed delighted to dwell on.

#11#


It was the first time she had listened to the syren tongue of flattery, which sounded in honied accents in her pleased ears, while self love and vanity made her fully convinced of the sincerity of it. Stanly easily perceived how much she was pleased with it, and he continued his insidious converse till they parted.

The elegant form of Stanly was not absent from the air-formed visions, which disturbed the slumbers of Emily, and she again, though, in idea beheld him, again saw his eyes fixed on her in all the tender expression of love, and again listened to his past converse.

<SceneMonologue>Struck with her beauty and unsuspecting innocence, Stanly that night long lay in wakeful ruminations, he saw clearly, that if he continued to breathe in her ears the delusive lan-

#12#

guage of flattery, that he should succeed in seducing her from the sweet paths of virtue.

A glow of anticipated happiness flushed his cheeks, as this idea dwelt in his bosom, but it was soon checked by that restless monitor, conscience.

<MonologueThought>Shall I, <M>said he, mentally apostrophising,</M> take a base advantage of her unsuspecting heart, to seek to win its affections, and for a momentary gratification ruin her peace, her fame, and all her prospects of happiness for ever: sweet girl, ignorant of the dark designs which were brooding in my bosom, she looked on me with pleasure, heard my false tales, and believed me sincere, while I exulted in my success. Oh man, what a treacherous, base, deceitful, being thou art, that can, under the specious mask of love, seek to pin the peace and soul’s

#13#

repose of a credulous female! No, never shall Stanly again have the guilt of seduction to answer for.</MonologueThought></SceneMonologue>

Such, in the moments of retirement, were Stanly’s reflections; and them, he determined should be the guide of his actions. His good genius then swayed his mind, his heart dilated with the anticipated pleasures of leading a virtuous life, and he would look back, with disgust and horror, on past hours of dissipation. But, alas, when mixing with the gay world, those sentiments and resolutions faded on his recollection, till by degrees the whole fabric of virtue, which he had raised, dissolved in air.

Society could not drive from his mind the lovely image of Emily: the beauties of other women failed in their attractions to please him, while he thought of her native charms;

#14#

anxious again to see her, He penned the following lines, and having, by means of the all-persuasive power of gold, succeeded in procuring the favor of Emily’s servant, she promised to give it privately to her mistress.

<QuotedText>"Lovely Emily,

“From the moment I parted from you life has become a burthen. In vain I look around me for comfort, for nowhere can I discover any charm to attach me to existence. The harmonious accents of your voice still vibrate on my soul, and your beauties, unceasing, live in my too tender recollection. Ah, my adored Emily ! could I but inspire in your bosom compassion for my suffering, it would be some consolation. Your love, angels can only aspire to, for only angels are worthy of such extatic bliss.

#15#


"Dearest Emily, will you permit me once more to hear the loved tones of your voice: and as the last cadence dies away in silence, may I, at that moment, expire; and my soul rise on the breeze that wafts the loved sound to Heaven.

"At the lonely hour of midnight, when the eyes of mortals are closed in sleep, excepting those whose cares and anxieties prevent the composing influence of the Deity of slumbers, do I sigh forth thy name ! ’Tis then I think that thou, sweet Emily, art enjoying the blessings of undisturbed repose: for love has not entered thy bosom, while mine is unceasingly tormented by the miseries of a hopeless passion.

"Dearest Emily, may I solicit, may I intreat you to grant me an interview ? give me, loveliest of women,

#16#

an opportunity to tell you how greatly I adore you; the pen’s weak efforts are inadequate to explain the impassioned sentiments of my bosom; but when added to the fervent effusions of the heart, they may perhaps give you some small idea of the love of
"Your ever sincere Adorer,
"Charles Stanly."</QuotedText>

The pleasure which Emily experienced on the perusal of Stanly’s letter, can only be conceived by those who have known what it is to love. His elegant person, his insinuating manners, and, above all, that specious air of truth and sincerity, which was so apparent in his discourse, came to her ready recollection; and she determined to comply with his request.

<Monologue>"Dear Charles,” <M>she mentally ut-

#17#

tered,</M> "your tender passion shall meet with a return from Emily: she will not prove ungrateful to such a lover. Yes; I will meet you; I will again hear those declarations so delightful to my ears, and again behold that form and those graces which have charmed my heart."</Monologue>

Such was the resolution which Emily formed on the perusal of Stanly’s letter; but it was a resolution made without reflection: for Emily, though influenced by her growing partiality for him, did not want for good sense; and when she began to give his request consideration, soon saw the great impropriety of acceding to it without the concurrence of her parents: but she was fearful of acquainting them with it; for she was certain her mother-in-law would severely reprimand her for opening the letter, and perhaps take

#18#

that opportunity to prevent her going into society, lest she should be guilty of greater errors: and her father, she,, but too wpll knew, would not dare to advise her without previously consulting Mrs. Henderson.

Thus, without a friend to direct her, Emily was obliged to follow her own counsel; and it may easily be imagined how very soon, in her youthful mind, the dictates of prudence, which would have made her refer Stanly to her parents, were regarded as cold and upfeeling; and at length completely over-ruled by the warm sentiments she cherished for him.

<Sententia>Fatal, indeed, is the situation of youth, when they cannot make a friend of their parents; and instead of feeling for them the sweet emotions of love, are never able to approach them without dread. Unfortunately, the ge-

#19#

nerality of parents seek to enforce obedience from their children, by making themselves objects of fear: but did they for a moment reflect how entirely, by such a conduct, they defeat their own purposes, how soon they destroy all sentiments of love and confidence in their children, they would never try to enforce the dictates of nature: and by so doing, entirely pervert them. Parental affection resides not in the same bosom, where fear has any sway: but when, by a gentleness of conduct, on the part of the parents, they insure the love of their offspring, the most implicit confidence and obedience follow, without being alarmed, through a dread of harsh reproofs or punishments; they confide to them the most secret emotions of their bosoms, and they feel a double pleasure in do-

#20#

ing so, because they know that it is their duty, and are sure of being listened to with kindness, and of being instructed in what is most proper for them to do.</Sententia>

<SceneQuasi>Emily’s decision will, therefore, be seen by the following lines which she sent in answer to Stanly’s letter.

<QuotedText>"Sir,
"Although I have not the vanity to think myself deserving of the protestations contained in your letter, yet I will not refuse your request. But as Ï cannot help being too conscious of the impropriety of so doing, without the knowledge of my parents, to them I shall, therefore, in future, refer you; and I trust you will consider this as the decided resolution of,
"Your humble Servant,
"EMILY HENDERSON"

#21#

"P. S. I shall be walking this evening, in the New Road, at seven o’clock.”</QuotedText>

After many attempts to answer Stanly, this letter, she resolved, should be sent; yet, when she had reperused it, she thought it too cold, too unfeeling, a return to his; and she had almost determined, that it should share the fate of those she had written before, when her maid, entering her apartment, acquainted her that Captain Stanly’s servant was waiting for her answer: she, therefore, hastily sealed and delivered it to the confidential domestic.</SceneQuasi>

Stanly smiled when he read her note; he saw from her ready compliance with his request, that he was not indifferent to her, and he trusted to artifice for postponing the time of waiting on her friends, till he had securely gained her

#22#

affections, when he well knew all her prudential résolutions would vanish; and it would be no longer necessary for him to dissimulate; for marriage was the last idea that would have occurred to him.

<SceneDia>Those who have loved, and have awaited, with anxious expectancy, the appointed time for meeting the object of their affections, can conceive by what they then felt, the situation of Emily, during the hours that brought on the one she had mentioned in her note, when she would see Stanly. She trembled, lest the agitation she felt should be perceived by the inquiring eye of Mrs. Henderson; or that she should be refused permission to go out in the evening — to escape observation, she retired to her apartment, and sat down to her music; but her trembling fingers could scarcely strike the notes:

#23#

and her voice, which used to be so harmonious, was now out of tune. She, therefore, left her piano, and took up a book, but her busy memory retaining every word, every tender expression in Stanly’s letter, her thoughts, were divided by that and the subject she was perusing, that she was unable to recollect what she was reading; and her ideas growing every moment more confused, she was obliged to close the volume.

The hour of dinner at length arrived, but Emily had no longer her usual appetite; and when it was over, she began to think what excuse she could invent, in order to obtain permission to go out — <Trigger>when,</Trigger> after some hesitation, she ventured to ask leave to pass the evening with Miss Fordyce.

<DiaM>“You are always wanting to go out, Miss Henderson,” <M>said her mother-in-

#24#

law</M>; "I think you might as well stay at home this evening: besides you saw Miss Fordyce last week.”</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Not last week, ma’am,” <M>faintly, replied Emily;</M> "for she was then at Windsor. It is now, I believe, near three weeks since.”</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You are always ready to contradict me, Miss,” <M>returned Mrs. Henderson</M>; "however, it is of no consequence when you saw her to me; and I do not choose you should go out th is evening.”</DiaM>

Emily did not dare to reply, but unable to hide her grief, she burst into tears, and went out of the room. Her father would gladly have given her the leave she desired, but he well knew what a storm he should bring upon himself, and which would descend also with tenfold weight on his daughter; he, therefore, was silent; but he took an opportunity of follow-

#25#

ing her, when she left the apartment, and told her, that as her mother was going the next evening to the opera, she should then have his permission to see Miss Fordyce.</SceneDia>

Emily’s grief was somewhat abated by her father’s kindness, but she was now greatly distressed in what manner she should acquaint Stanly with her not being able to perform her promise; and, on this occasion, she was obliged to make her servant her confidant.

Betty, who had been often employed in love affairs, readily promised to meet Stanly, and deliver to him any message which Emily thought proper to send; she, therefore, wrote a few lines to acquaint him, that being unable to go out, she would see him the next evening, at the time she had before appointed, if he was disengaged.

Betty took the note, and Stanly slipping into her hand a couple of

#26#

guineas, bade her inform her mistress that he would not fail to be there.

When the next evening came, Mrs. Henderson departed at an early hour; and Emily prepared to meet her lover.

<SceneDia>Intent on the prosecution of his base plans, he hastened to the place of appointment, and soon beheld the fascinating form of Emily approaching.

Conscious that she was acting wrong, and fearful of being discovered, the rose but paly blushed in her cheeks; but when Stanly addressed her in that tender and respectful language, which he well knew how to use, it soon tended to soothe the agitation of her bosom, and render it sufficiently composed to listen with delight to his fascinating conversation.

Leaving the road, they walked into the fields, which were decked with the luxuriant productions of nature; the white blossoms of May gave their fra-

#27#

grance to the gentle zephyrs that sported around them, and the song of the birds, as they nestled their young, was faintly heard; the last beams of the sun trembled on the distant steeples, and summits of the lofty trees, and at length he sunk below the western horizon; but not at the moment that he retired to gladden other worlds with his cheering rays, was his total departure manifest; for the clouds, in their fleecy bosoms, retained his borrowed radiance; and then bright reflexes cast a rich glow over the surrounding scenery.

The hills of Highgate and Hampstead, covered with romantic habitations, deep seated amidst embowering shrubs, and shaded by lofty trees, rose in front; between them seemed to repose a beautiful valley, over which the misty robe of evening was now beginning to collect its fleecy folds.

#28#


Such was the prospect that presented itself to the view of Emily and Charles, as they strolled along the fields.

<DiaM>"How grateful," <M>said he,</M> "do I feel for your dear acquiescence to my request. Oh ! beauteous Emily, what a charm does your presence give to nature; how lovely does she now appear! You are the dear sun which eradiates the scene, and decks all around you with smiling gaity. — Oh! Emily, may I hope, that my tenderest assiduities, my ardent love, may be returned by the lovely angel, who, first, in my bosom, awoke that dear sensation. Tell me, sweetest Emily, may Stanly indulge that heavenly hope?”</DiaM>

Here he gazed on his fair companion; his eyes spoke the emotions of his bosom; his hand, which had gently pressed hers, trembled; and

#29#

his whole frame seemed greatly agitated, while he awaited her answer.

Emily blushed — the soft temperature of the atmosphere, the fragrance of the whispering zephyr, and the tranquil scene before her, joined to the elegant form of Stanly, the persuasive tones of his voice, and his interesting manners, had lulled to forgetfulness the dictates of prudence; while the anxiety, that was depicted, in his countenance, as he was awaiting her answer to his question, awoke all the tender emotions of love in her bosom; and her heart beat with increasing violence against her side, while, with downcast eyes and averted face, she replied:

<DiaQ>"My compliance, with your request, in meeting you this evening, without the sanction of my parents and, by so doing, risking their displeasure, must, I am sure, be a con-

#30#

vincing proof, that, you are not indifferent to me."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Lovely angel!” <M>Stanly replied,</M> "what heavenly bliss has your dear reply imparted to my bosom! Oh! can I ever be sufficiently grateful for such goodness; can I ever make a return worthy of it !”</DiaM>

Stanly imprinted on the hand of the trembling Emily a thousand kisses, while her eyes sparkled with delight, and his enraptured emotions shook his frame.

Emily's heart, so feelingly alive to sensibility, swelled with sensation of the most exquisite pleasure; she beheld before her the man she adored; one, on whom nature had been lavish in adorning with every winning, every captivating, manly grace. She saw him in extacies, at the answer she had given him; she partook of his happiness. — It was, indeed, a dangerous

#31#

moment for Emily. — <Sententia><Metaphor>Love, powerful love, was then twining about her yielding heart his golden toils, and securely binding it in his glittering fetters.</Metaphor></Sententia>

Stanly gazed with delight on her blushing countenance; he gently put his arm round her waist; and, with a look of tender entreaty, which Emily could not resist, joined his lips to hers.

<AuthorI>Gentle spirits of love and sainted modesty, you, who give to the eyes their animated sparkling radiance, and you, who call the crimson tint on the downy cheek, assist me, I conjure you, to describe the sensations of Emily.

But the weak efforts of the pen are not able: the most animated description would fall tar short of the reality.</AuthorI>

Emily, at length, with a tremulous effort, loosed herself from the embrace of Stanly; and hanging down her lovely

#32#

head to conceal her blushes, entreated him to return, as it was growing late.

He complied with her request; and, as they walked back, extorted from her a promise to meet him again at the same place.</SceneDia>

<SceneQuasi>When they separated, Emily hastened to Miss Fordyce; but the servant informed her she was gone to the opera: terrified with this intelligence, Emily knew not what excuse to make for having been so long out; for she was afraid to say that she had been with Miss Fordyce, lest Mrs. Henderson might have seen her at the opera; and as it was now past nine, she expected that her father would shortly send a servant for her.

In this dilemma she remained a few moments, till, at length, she resolved on staying at the house till her servant should come, which happened to be very soon after she had entered it.

#33#


When she came home, her father asked some trifling questions about her young friend, but, she informed him, that, owing to the ignorance of the servant where his mistress was, she had been kept waiting at the house, in expectation of her return, till it was too late for her to come home without her attendant.

Emily could not tell this untruth, without feeling how very culpable she was in deceiving her father — true, indeed, it is, that the commission of one fault leads to many. She retired, at an early hour, to her chamber, and there reflected on the impropriety of her conduct; but, alas! she felt an excuse, as well as a sanction, for it, in her increasing love for Stanly.</SceneQuasi>

Emily now considered, that, to make Miss Fordyce acquainted with her attachment, would be absolutely necessary, in order to afford her opportuni-

#34#

ties of seeing Stanly without fear of being discovered.

<ChBioIntro><ChNameIntro>Miss Fordyce</ChNameIntro> was about three years older than Emily; and having studied romances three years longer, her brain was so discomposed by them, that, at length, she worked herself into a belief, that she was the heroine of every publication of that kind which she perused; her midnight slumbers were disturbed, as she often imagined, by spectral forms gliding along the chamber; and the deep snores of a drowsy watchman, whose box was near her residence, she often conceived were the groans of some unquiet spirit. Her parents were both dead, and she was left to the guardianship of an aunt, whose increasing years and infirmities rendered her unable to attend to her niece's conduct. Miss Fordyce was, in the general opinion, a fine girl, dark hair, expressive eyes, an acqui-

#35#

line nose, and to conclude, the description of her face in Sir John Suckling’s words.

<QuotedLit>"Her lips were red and one was thin,
Compared to that 'twas next her chin,
Some Bee had stung it newly.”</QuotedLit></ChBioIntro>

<Backstory>She had long nourished a secret attachment for a beardless Ensign, who could not boast much of one half of his ancestors. For it happened, that as his father, a gay young Colonel, who, sometimes forgot a certain domestic establishment of a wife and two lovely infants, was taking a solitary ride near his estate, he was accosted by a pretty looking Gipsy, who begged to tell his honor his fortune.

The Colonel was struck with two fine dark eyes, white teeth, and a pair of rosy cheeks, in spite of the walnut juice which had darkened her skin; the place they were in was a bye-lane; and the Gipsy, though skilled in

#36#

foretelling events which would happen to others, had forgot to open the volume of futurity, in regard to herself, and, consequently, did not, at that time, foresee, that, in nine months, she would become a mother to a near relation of the worthy Colonel.

<SceneQuasi>After an occurrence which is hinted at above, the Colonel returned to his house arid in the evening, <Trigger>as</Trigger> he was walking in the garden, with his lady, was somewhat disturbed, at beholding his inamorata at the gates.

The Colonel never conceived any action of his criminal, till it was discovered; and, therefore, to prevent his attaching any guilt to the events of the morning, as soon as he saw the Gipsy, pretended to take a shilling from his pocket, in order to send her immediately away. <DiaM>“That the servants," as he said, "might not encourage those vermin, who have no

#37#

other intent than to steal whatever they can lay their hands on.”</DiaM>

His lady was of the same opinion: and the Colonel, stepping forward, gave her the shilling; which, however, concealed a piece of exactly twenty-one times its value: and the Gipsy, whose visit there was entirely accidental, well-pleased, immediately departed.</SceneQuasi> She did not, however, forget the residence of her sudden admirer, and the situation, in which she found herself some few weeks after, contributed to imprint it more firmly in her mind.

<SceneDia>The Colonel had entirely forgot the circumstance: when, a few months after, as he was driving his lady in his curricle, he again met the Gipsy; and as he passed her, could not help being struck with her corporeal situation: and fearing, lest she might pay him a visit, took the earliest opportu-

#38#

nity of returning home; and then walked alone to the place where he hack seen the Gipsy, who expected no less, from the agitation which had suddenly disturbed his features: for during the six months she had been wandering about, since she last saw the Colonel, she had collected a considerable portion of experience as well as cunning; and knowing the Colonel’s situation, as a married man, she looked on him as a certain source from whence she might procure money whenever she was in want, through his fears of that organ of scandal, her tongue.

The Colonel was marching on,

<QuotedLit>"Whistling as he went for want of thought."</QuotedLit>

At length met the Gipsy; and, agreeable to the mode of defence which he had planned, affected to be surprized at the acquaintance which she appeared to claim with him; for she had dropped a curtsey, and, <FIDquotes>“hoped

#39#

his honor had been well since she last saw him."</FIDquotes>

<DiaM>"Good woman," <M>said the Colonel</M>, "you are mistaken with respect to the person you address: I do not recollect ever having seen you before.”</DiaM>

The Gipsy smiled, and hinted at certain particulars: but the Colonel's recollection was still obstinate: till at length she grew enraged, and, according, to the vulgar phrase, let loose her tongue at him, which, indeed, is not so incorrect a speech, or so devoid of meaning, as many other cant terms: <Sententia>for a woman’s tongue, when unchained by passion, is <Metaphor>like a wild beast broken from its confinement, which runs furiously on, attacking every one it meets, nor stops, till entirely incapacitated by fatigue, from further motion.</Metaphor></Sententia>

<Dia>"Well, your honor, I could not have suspected this usage from a gentleman like you; first, to ruin a poor

#40#

girl; and then, to deny it to her face: you ought to be ashamed of yourself; that’s what you ought: but I know what I know; and the whole parish shall know it too: and I’ll go this instant and swear my child against you before a Justice of the Peace; and I’ll let your Lady know; and" —</Dia>

Here the Colonel thought it full time to call a halt.

<DiaM>"Why sure," <M>said he, endeavouring to recollect,</M> "you are not the same little girl that some month ago —"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes; I am," <M>returned the woman</M>; "and that you know well enough: for you changed colour when you saw me, as you was riding with your Lady, ah if she knew how you had abused my vartue — but it’s no matter; for I will be neglected: that I will."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Well; you might have told me all this without putting yourself in a passion,” <M>returned the Colonel; taking from his pocket a five pound

#41#

note, which he unfolded and gave her.</M></DiaM>

Had an Indian, a Hottentot, or any othér superstitious race of beings, who were entirely unacquainted with the use of those slips of paper, been standing by at that moment, viewing the angry gestures and the infuriated eyes of the Gipsy, and hearing her loud voice, and had likewise, beheld the sudden change that took place on,the application of the note to her hand, he would certainly have gone away fully impressed with a belief that the English deal in magic; and carry in their pockets charms and enchantments.

The Gipsy's passion immediately subsided: she thanked his honor; <FID>was sure his honour was too good to let her want, now that she was unable to work for her bread; that she had declined coming near him as long as possible; but now was obliged by necessity.</FID>

During her speech the Colonel was ruminating on what course he should pursue to rid himself of a claimant who was likely to become troublesome; and having, at last, thought of a mode, he asked her if she would, like to marry: adding, that if she was so inclined, he would get a husband for her, and make her a present of a hundred pounds on her wedding-day, provided she conducted herself properly.

To this, as it may be supposed, the Gipsy was not slow in giving her consent: and after he had made himself acquainted with the place of her abode, he departed: not very well pleased with the trouble he had brought upon himself.</SceneDia>

When he had first entered his regiment, he had taken some notice of the wife of one of the privates; which being observed by the husband, he was obliged to silence him by a present

#43#

and a promise of promotion; in which being as good as his word, the man soon after rose to the rank of corporal, and from that to serjeant. The Colonel had lately heard of the death of that man's wife: he, therefore, sent for him; and, having disclosed his situation with the Gipsy, offered her to the Serjeant as his bride, with some of those prevailing slips of paper, to the amount agreed on: promising, likewise, that he would take care of the child.

The Serjeant, like a good soldier, found no difficulty in considering the wishes of his Colonel, as his orders; particularly as they promised to be so advantageous; and departed to see his intended spouse, to whom, in a few days, he became inseparably united: though a circumstance that occured at the altar, had like to have prevented it for a time; for the Gipsy

#44#

could not recollect that she had any other name than Brown Bess: the singularity of which occasioning some questions, she was going to declare that she had never been christened, when the Serjeant interrupted her at that important moment, by declaring to the Clerk that her name was Betsy Brown.

Two months after the Serjeant became the happy father of a fine boy, who was called after his name, Edmund Walter; and who, in process of time became, by the Colonel’s interest, an Ensign in a, regiment, then under orders for the West Indies.

<ChPortrait>Young Walter was possessed of a line figure; and though not a handsome, yet a pleasing countenance. His education had not been entirely neglected; for the Serjeant had a brother who, being the master of a charity-school, kindly included Walter

#45#

amongst his pupils. Walter was possessed of a cunning and duplicity, but rarely seen at his years: whether it was that he had imbibed it with his earliest sustenance, or that nature had endued him with it, is uncertain; but he was a character that few could read, and fewer understand.</ChPortrait></Backstory>

It was at a ball in the country that he became acquainted with Miss Fordyce, who, strange as it may appear, became enamoured of him, on account of his being called Edmund: a name which had frequently been given to various heros in the romances she had perused; and immediately concluding that he was possessed of all their virtues, resigned to him her affections.

Walter was not long before he observed the preference which Miss Fordyce entertained for him; and learning that she would be entitled to a considerable property when she came

#46#

of age, he studied her character: and, at length, taking advantage of her romantic disposition, wound himself so deeply into her affections, that they were on the point of setting ont to pay a visit to the Blacksmith at Gretna Green, who forges the chains of matrimony, when his regiment was ordered on its march to Portsmouth, and he could not obtain the requisite leave of absence.

It was now, for the first time, that Walter understood that the fortune of Miss Fordyce would be forfeited if she married before she was of age, without the approbation of her friends; and he blessed his lucky stars that he had obtained this important information in time. After many delays the orders for the embarkation of his regiment were countermanded; and Walter waited with impatience till Miss Fordyce should arrive to the age of twen-

#47#

ty-one, which now would be in the course of a year.

The tongue of scandal had often whispered in her ears the origin of her lover: but Miss Fordyce had read so many instances of the offsprings of peasants attracting the love of highborn dames, that she would exclaim with the elegant Cartwright,

<QuotedLit>"What ! though he boast no titled name,
"No wide extent of rich domain;
"Yet must he feed a hopeless flame,
"Must truth and nature plead in vain?”</QuotedLit>

Such was the situation of Miss Fordyce’s attachment, which she kept a profound secret from her Aunt, when Emily disclosed to her, under a solemn promise of privacy, her love for Stanly.

Miss Fordyce was delighted at being the confidant of a tender flame; and in return informed Emily of the situation of her own heart: she pro-

#48#

mised to do every thing in her power to procure her opportunities of seeing Stanly; and, in order to effect it, that day a formal note arrived from her requesting her company in the Evening.

Mrs. Henderson, as was her constant custom, perused all letters that came, either to her husband or her daughter-in-law, before she allowed them to see them; and being pleased with some expressions which Miss Fordyce had made use of respecting herself, gave Emily the desired leave.

Betty was, therefore, dispatched with a note to Stanly, that he might repair to the appointed place, whither Emily, with all the fond impatience of love, hastened to meet him.

She now, without reserve, made him acquainted with her uncomfortable situation at home, which information Stanly did not fail to take advantage of, and represented to her how ill-

#49#

judged it would be at that time for him to disclose his passion to Mr. Henderson, since it was but too likely that his wife would instantly set her face against the marriage, because, in the first place, her father would be obliged to place his daughter’s fortune in her own possession; and, secondly, that in preventing the union, she would have the pleasure of making the object of her hate miserable. — <SpeechInsert>"As to pecuniary motives for our union," <M>continued Stanly,</M> "believe me, my adored Emily, I have none: my fortune is sufficient to maintain us both; if not in affluence, at least in comfort: but it is yourself, dearest angel, that I consider: for there might cqme a time when you would look with coolness on Stanly, and reproach him with his precipitancy. — There is also another reason for avoiding the disclosure at the present moment; for it is not unlikely

#50#

that your cruel mother-in-law would either instantly confine you to the house or send you to some distant part of the country, where my eyes will no longer be blessed with the sight of your charms, or my ears ravished with the harmonious tones of your voice."</SpeechInsert>

Shocked at such an idea, Emily no longer thought of consulting her friends; and resolved, at least for the present, to keep secret her love for Stanly, and to continue their clandestine meetings; which, by means of Miss Fordyce, she would be easily enabled to do.

<SpeechInsert>"Wait a little longer with patience, my adored love," said Stanly, as they were going to part, "the envious clouds that obscure the bright sun of our happiness, and darken the. scenes around, will soon disperse, and disclose to us the lovely prospect of future years of Halcyon joys."</SpeechInsert>

#51#


Their meetings were now frequent. Miss Fordyce, by dint of flattery, had procured so entirely the friendship of Mrs. Henderson, that she never refused her repeated request for Emily’s company: and Stanly, seeing that he had completely engaged her affections, determined not to wait much longer e’er he put himself in possession of these charms, for which he so greatly longed. Though, at times, his conscience would reproach him from the cruel deed he perpetrated, and he would resolve to cease from his present pursuit: but whenever he beheld the beauteous Emily, all his good intentions vanished; and his evil resolutions took so firm a hold of him, that, at length, he gave himself entirely up to their influence; contenting himself with endeavouring to ease his accusing conscience by promise of future amendment.

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER II.</ChapMarker>

<ChapTitle>Cousin Tom's.</ChapTitle>

<Sententia>The ministers of pleasure’s votaries are many: for pleasure assumes a thousand shapes, various are the taste and pursuits of mankind: but that description of people to which we would particularly allude, are those whom it is fashionable to call by the familiar appellations of mother or cousin.</Sententia>

<AuthorialObservation>Au uninformed person, on hearing the conversation, of a man of fashion of the present day, and who considered parental affection as a virtue, would be delighted on finding that it was his intention to pass his evening with Mother Windsor; or that he meant, the next day, to pay a visit to Cousin Tom — how greatly would he esteem the

#53#

man who could dedicate his time to alleviate the cares and pains of age; and chose to associate with his relations, rather than mix with the giddy throng? How gladly would he return to his friends in the country, and acquaint them that virtue was not extinct in London.

Houses of intrigue assume such various appearances, that the most cautious may be often deceived by them. Few would imagine that a seemingly respectable house in the vicihity of Bond Street, where female dresses are exposed for sale, and where many ladies of the strictest virtue are continually seen making their various purchases, should be appropriated for the purposes of vice; and that a door at the further end of the largest apartment should open into a <i>boudoir</i> dedicated to the votaries of the Paphian Goddess. Concealment of the real trade which is

#54#

carried on in these kinds of houses is particularly studied: hence it is not unusual for a fruit shop to have a convenient back parlor; or, for a milliner to keep a set of handsome girls to sell ribbons to gentlemen.</AuthorialObservation>

<SceneAction>It was to one of these places that Stanly determined to take the unsuspecting Emily: and accordingly, <Trigger>as they were returning one evening</Trigger> from their usual stroll in the fields, as they were in the neighbourhood of Queen Ann Street, East, he was apparently attracted by some early cherries that were displayed in the windows of a certain fruit shop; and pretending to be thirsty with the warmth of the evening, easily prevailed on his fair companion to enter.

A woman of a decent appearance was setting behind the counter, whom Stanly had previously instructed how to act; and who, when he complained

#55#

that there were no chairs in the shop, begged he would step up stairs into the drawing room, where she would bring him the fruit he wished.

Emily, as unsuspecting as our first mother, of the snare that was laid for her, agreed to go up with Stanly; and was conducted by the woman into a handsome well-furnished apartment. — The sofa was very much tumbled; but she hastily smoothed it, making an apology at the same time, by saying, that her last lodgers had but just quitted it, and she had not had time to put the room to rights.

Some fruit was now brought up; and the woman closing the door, left them together.

It was then that Stanly, kneeling before the lovely Emily, again breathed into her delighted ears those soft expressions which vibrated on her tender heart, and transported her beyond her-

#56#

self. He kissed her tender hands; till growing bolder he, a second time, pressed his lips to her's.

Emily made but a faint resistance: and Stanly repeated his caresses, till alarmed by the shades of evening which en veil oped the room, she observed to Stanly that she must depart, as it was necessary she should call on Miss Fordyce to plan the coming of the servant, who always called to attend her home.

Stanly at first told her it was not so late as she imagined; that the darkness of the apartment was owing to the Venetian blinds which were let down before the windows: but Emily was anxious to return, lest by any accident, her mode of	passing her evenings should be discovered; and Stanly did not think it prudent to press her to stay, for, fear of exciting her suspicions: they therefore left the house; and soon after

#57#

parted near the residence of Emily's confidential friend.</SceneAction>

Emily, therefore, for the present, happily escaped the snare into which she had so nearly fallen. Fortunate, indeed, would it have been for her, could she have known the base designs of Stanly; but she trusted to his honor, to that specious air of sincerity which veiled his dark intentions from her observance. And as to have thought him false, would have made her the most miserable of women: so she studiously avoided every idea which tended that way; and as her love increased, so did her confidence in him.

<SceneReadingWriting>Miss Fordyce, with a vanity excusable in a female of her years, plotted herself on her poetic talents; <Trigger>and when Emily entered,</Trigger> she found her busily employed with her pen: and as to be solicitous to hear her productions was a sure way of pleasing her, Emily

#58#

waited till she had concluded; and then requested to read the lines she had written, which were as follows:

<QuotedText>THE FAIR ISABELL

And pale is the rose on fair Isabell's cheek,
And gone is the lustre that beam’d in her eye;
As she pac’d ocean’s side her fond lover to seek;
Or the tall rising mast ok his ship to espy.

And silent the halls that once were so gay,
And sadly the minstrel doth wander forlorn;
For mute are the strings he once tun’d to his lay,
And mute the blythe sounds of the echoing horn.

"And now, my loved Isabell, I must depart;
And now must I leave thee, I so much adore:
Ah ! sad is the sigh which doth rend my fond heart.
Oh! soon may the fates to your arms me restore."

Sad, sad was the parting of lovers so dear;
Deep, deep was the sigh which oft burst from each breast;
And oft down each cheek roll’d the anguish-caus’d tear;
And deep was the grief which their fond hearts possest.

#59#


"And oh ! my dear knight," said the sorrowing fair,
"In the hour of danger; ah, think of your love!
And oh! of a life so precious take care:
For only by that you your passion can prove."

And now his tall vessel divided the wave:
And sadly fair Isabell stood on the shore:
For sore did she mourn for her warrior so brave;
And greatly she fear'd she should ne’er see him more.

The months they roll’d on, the years pass’d away,
But the Knight to his love ne’er returned;
And sadly fair Isabell grieved at his stay,
And sadly each hour she mourned.

One evening so sad as she paced ocean’s side,
His cold corpse it was cast on the shore:
Full sadly she shrieked as his form she espied;
And life warmed her sad bosom no more.</QuotedText>

Emily concluded with a sigh, at the unfortunate end of the lovers; and Miss Fordyce, pleased with having excited her sensibility, was going to submit some other of her productions to her perusal, but was prevented by the arrival of Emily's servant; she had,


#60#

therefore, only time to make the necessary arrangements for her next meeting with Stanly e’er she departed.</SceneReadingWriting>

Stanly, unable to forget for a moment the kisses he had ravished from the tender lips of Emily, awaited with anxious expectation the next meeting: when, fearful of exciting suspicion, he determined to take her to another house which was more convenient for the foul purpose he meditated.

Not a hundred miles from the centre of Soho Square is one of those relations to the votaries of pleasure which we hinted at in the second page of this chapter: by them, both male and female, he is familiarly styled Cousin Tom, who following the same road his father did before him, lives on the vices of others. It was to the residence of this High Priest of sin that Stanjy resolved to take Emily; and he accordingly arranged certain matters

#61#

that were necessary to lull her suspicions.

Miss Fordyce had been obliged to go out of town for seven or eight days; therefore Emily, during that time, had no opportunity of meeting Stanly but through the medium of Betty. She had received letters from him which teemed with expressions of his love; and of his misery, in being so long deprived of seeing the sweet angel he adored.

<SceneQuasi>However, Miss Fordyce at length returned; and in order to make amends for her absence which was unavoidable, being obliged to visit a near relation, she called on her the moment she arrived; and after complementing Mrs. Henderson on her looks, and protesting she grew younger every day, and repeating those well-known lines of Aaron Hill,

#62#


<QuotedLit>Age has But one defect, and that’s decay:
Your beauty fades not, and your grates stay.
All the dear difference that your years inspire,
In ripen’d wisdom, and increase of fire.
Brighfning by age, you grow like gold in mines
Which length of time corrodes not, but refines."</QuotedLit>

Concluded them with a request for Emily’s company the next evening to a small circle of her friends.

Miss Fordyce’s complement was not lost on a vain woman, who had some time arrived at what the French term <i>un certain age,</i> which, though a very uncertain way of expressing it, is generally concluded by Englishmen to be fast verging on forty: but <AuthorWe>as we have an illustrious precedent that, at forty and upwards, <Sententia>the charms of a female have been able to attract the most insatiate votary of pleasure</Sententia>,</AuthorWe> a recollection which never departed Mrs. Henderson’s memory; she by no means thought herself past the me-

#63#

ridian of pleasing, though she had passed the meridian of life: indeed she owned she was forty; but as that assertion was recollected by her friends to have been made some years back, we may almost venture to conclude that she was hastily approaching an additional <i>decade</i>.

Her vanity would not allow her to conceive, that the lines repeated by Miss Fordyce were any other than an <i>impromptu</i>, occasioned by the force of her attractions, which even her own sex could not deny she possessed: she was therefore highly delighted with them; and begged that Miss Fordyce would commit them to paper; with which she having complied, she again repeated they were vastly pretty; and readily accorded to her solicitation for Emily’s company; and even promised not to send the servant for her; but that Miss Fordyce should

#64#

send her aunt’s with her when the party broke up.</SceneQuasi>

Thus did every circumstance conspire to give Stanly an opportunity of robbing the innocent, fond Emily, of that inestimable treasure, her virtue. <SceneAction>He soon was informed by her of the leave she had obtained; and as the weather was rather unsettled, innocently asked if he thought they could not stay an hour or two at the fruit shop, in case it should be so wet as to prevent theiy walking.

Stanly reserved his reply ’till he met her, when he told her that his regard for her was so great, that for fear the woman of the shop should think it singular, he had promised to pass the evening at the house of a friend, who, was lately married to a near relation, and who, knowing his intentions of being united to her as soon as circumstances should permit,

#65$

would be happy to be introduced to her.

Such was Stanly’s answer; <trigger>and coming to a stand,</trigger> he helped Emily into a coach, and, in a low voice, told the man where to drive: he was, however, overheard by the waterman, who, as the coach rolled off, winked at one of the coachmen who was sitting on his box, at the same time saying in a voice loud enough to be heard by Stanly,

<DiaQ>“I say, Jack, there they go. She looks like a new hand. I ha’nt seen her face before.”</DiaQ>

<DiaM>“Why: where be they going?" <M>said the coachman</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, to Tom <Cryptonym>-----’s</Cryptonym>,” <M>returned the waterman; repeating the whole of the High Priest’s name.</M></DiaM>

Stanly hastily drew up the glasses, lest Emily should hear more than he wished: but though indeed she heard

#66#

what the man said, as she was not able to attach any meaning to it, she let it pass unnoticed.

The coach driving through a square and down a narrow street, stopped at a large door, before which was a porch. The coach-door was immediately opened by a man-servant, who, letting down the steps, Stanly enquired if Colonel Robarts was within: and the servant having replied in the affirmative, he helped Emily to alight, and, preceded by the man, entered a large handsome drawing room, at the upper end of which, on a sofa, sat a gentleman and a lady, whom Stanly introduced to Emily as Colonel and Mrs. Robarts; but who were in fact no other than Tom, the High Priest; and one of his Priestesses, hired for the occasion.

The conversation was of a general nature; and Emily could not avoid observing, that the Lady expressed

#67#

herself sometimes in rather a coarse, vulgar manner: Colonel Robarts, however, conducted himself in the easy, familiar style, of a man of fashion: for <Reader>the reader</Reader> must be informed that Tom received his education at a large seminary at the West End of the town; and if the company of the female part of the creation, can tend to polish the manners of mankind, Tom had certainly, throughout his life, no reason to complain of being in want of their society, or, consequently, of sufficient opportunity .of receiving instruction.

Coffee was now served up in an elegant style; after which the Colonel and his Lady withdrew, pretending they had some particular business which required them to go out immediately; and begged that they would not think of waiting supper for them, as their return was very uncertain.

#68#


Stanly was now left alone with Emily, alone in a house where, by the prevailing power of gold, every one was at his command; where, indeed, their very senses were guided by him: for if bribed so to do, they never heard the screams of innocence contending with barbarous man; the groans of the ruined, undone female, bewailing the loss of her honor, were there regarded <Metaphor>as lightly as the wind that sighed among the trees</Metaphor>. Even the watchmen, as they passed by, instinctively turned away their heads, while they vociferated the hour in louder tones, in order to drown the clamors that sometimes were raised within the walls of that prophane temple.

It happened unfortunately, that while Stanly was pouring forth his soul to Emily, while he gazed, delighted, on the impassioned glances of her eyes, as she was listening to his too pleasing

#69#

discourse, and which he well knew was owing to the effects of a certain powder which lie had dexterously contrived to put into her coffee, in order that he might be secure of his intended prey, that he was suddenly disturbed by a confusion of voices which seemed to come from the chambers above; and presently some persons were heard descending the stairs; and shortly after the voice of a man seemingly endeavouring to pacify a woman who, however, scarcely listened to him: for she exclaimed,

<DiaQ>"I dont care for noise; not I. I’ll raise the house on you. This is your way: is it: but it wont do with me; I promise you. I’m not one of your seven-shilling sort.”</DiaQ>

The man again replied in few words, but uttered in a low voice, which Stanly was enable to distinguish: the female, however; was sufficiently loud.

#70#


<DiaM>“You’re a nasty, mean, sneaking, pitiful fellow," <M>returned the Lady,</M> "and let who may hear me, I care not a fig — you give me seven shillings — you a Lord — damn my eyes, but I’ll darken your glimmers, you little crooked, nut-cracking son---".</DiaM>

More words were uttered - but the disputants having descended to the apartments below, were heard no more.

Stanly affected to be in the utmost astonishment; and went out of the apartment, in order to inquire into the cause of the disturbance to pacify Emily, who was greatly terrified. He was enraged in the highest degree at a circumstance which promised to defeat his plans. But seing that quiet was restored, he returned and told Emily; that the servants, taking advantage of their master’s absence, had got tipsy; and entreated her not to be in any manner alarmed, as they had quitted the house.

#71#


Stanly had, however, some difficulty to make Emily forget her late terrors, and to be sufficiently composed to listen to him; but, at length, on finding that the noise was not renewed, she recovered her spirits, and at the earnest recommendation of Stanly drank a glass of wine.

Her eyes again resumed their sparkling radiance; the wine which was very strong, joined to the drugged coffee, tended to exhilarate her spirits: she permitted her lover to kiss her without reproving him, let his arm embrace her slender waist, till at length Stanly triumphed, and Emily was ruined.

<Sententia>Alas! such is the worldly expression; is it a triumph then to seduce an innocent, unsuspecting; female from the sweet paths of virtue, to plunge them into every species of misery and wretchedness. If it is a triumph, it is that of the restless enemy of man; the

#72#

seducer is his friend, for by his means how many become his prey, he indeed triumphs in the guilty act.</Sententia>

Emily was for some time silent; she hid her face with her hands: Stanly endeavoured to compose her agitations, he embraced her; but his conscience, that restless monitor, now goaded him with its sharp sting, and he was confused, and unknowing what to say, because he felt how guilty he was.

<DiaM>"Oh,Charles!” <M>sighed Emily,</M> "what have I done, how cruel was it of you to take advantage of my love to ruin me: now! shall be for ever wretched, lost, abandoned by happiness and by my friends."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh! say not so, my love,” <M>returned Stanly,</M> "’tis you that are to dictate, and I will readily perform whatever will conduce to your comfort; believe me, I sincerely regret the past, but we were both impelled by the ex-

#73#

cess of out attachment: shall I go to your father, endeavour to obtain his consent and be united to you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I know not how to advise you," <M>returned Emily, weeping</M>; "but I never shall be happy till then; and then, perhaps, you will reproach me with the tender proof of love which I have given you; I have heard of such things: alas ! I have every thing now to fear, before - Oh God ! would I could recall this evening."</DiaM>

Here her tears stopped her further utterance, and she remained silent, leaning on Stanly, who pressing her to his bosom, endeavoured to console her, when the watchman went by the house, calling half past eleven o’clock — his naming the time awoke her from her sad ruminations, and assisted by Stanly, she arose to adjust her dress and to prepare for her departure.

The night was wet and <Metaphor>comfortless

#74#

as the thoughts of the unfortunate Emily.</Metaphor> The servant was some time e’er he could procure a coach; at length, however, he was successful; and Emily, with a heavy heart, was passing through the hall, when a thundering knock was heard, and two bucks rushed in, to all appearance <DoxaQuotes>“hot with the Tuscan grape.”</DoxaQuotes>

<DiaM>"What, Stanly, is that you!” <M>— said one</M>, "I’m precious glad to see you; strike me quizzical if I a'nt — what, going so soon! quiz me, but I must have a kiss of that girl.”</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Indeed, my lord, but you shall not,” <M>returned Stanly, in an angry tone</M>; "this lady is a relation, a —”</DiaM>

<Dia>“Oh! a relation! ha! ha! ha! Quiz me, Stanly, but that’s good: one of your nieces, I suppose.”</Dia>

<DiaM>"Let me pass, my lord, or I shall be obliged to make use of harsh means,” <M>replied Stanly,</M> "you are intoxicated

#75#

and unable to perceive the pain you are giving this lady, who is almost ready to faint with the terror caused by your rudeness.”</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ready to faint! quiz me, but that’s odd, I like to see a woman fainting; she looks so in—in—interesting;” <M>returned the noble Lord, applying a glass to his eye</M>.</DiaM>

The other Buck had till then been silent; he seemed, indeed, to be exerting all his powers to preserve an equilibrium: but he kept reeling on till, at length, his back meeting the wall, he stood there: he now seemed to make some efforts to speak; and at length, though interrupted by a frequent hicup, he continued to say, — 

<DiaQ>"I think, Mr. Sta—Stanly, you have made u-u—use of insulting language to his lordship. D—n me, and I'm his friend; and wont stand still and tame-tamely see him abused. D—n me."</DiaQ>

#76#


<DiaM>"When you are able to stand still,” <M>said Stanly,</M> "I will answer you; till then you will excuse me for not attending to what you say ! — My Lord, will you let the Lady pass.”</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No: I'll be d-mn-d if I do, without a kiss,” <M>returned his lordship; at the same time holding out his arms to Emily; when Stanly starting forward, pushed him back with such violence, that his Lordship measured his length on the floor, where he seemed to lay very composedly, without betraying the smallest inclination to get up</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"D—n me, Lord Boson, if you will take that, I wont. I tell you what, Sir, you are a puppy, Sir, and — and I’ll ca-cane you, Sir —”</Dia>

So saying, he lifted up a small stick which hung dangling from his wrist by a silken cord, and offered to strike Stanly, who snatching it from him, broke it into pieces, and with the great-

#77#

est contempt flung them in his face. At the same time passing on with Emily, who was scarcely able to stand, he assisted her into the carriage; calling out at the same time to the Waiters to tell Lord Boson, that he was ready to give him satisfaction whenever he pleased.

The coach now rolled off, and Emily gradually recovering of her terrors which the late fracas had occasioned, had more leisure to reflect on her own miserable situation.</SceneAction>

<SceneDia>Miss Fordyce was under some anxiety respecting her friend’s return, as it had struck twelve; and she could in no way account for her staying to so late an hour with Stanly, romantic as she was, though she knew it was the custom for, lovers to walk together by moonlight, <QuotesOther>"when the song of the birds is no longer heard in the groves, and nature seems hushed to repose, save the

#78#

Nightingale who tunes her love-labored ditty.”</QuotesOther> Though she knew that then was the time for lovers to whisper their soft tales, yet that night was far from answering the above description. It was a night when <QuotesOther>"the loud winds roared amongst the tenantry of the forest, and the pityless pelting of the storm was heard around, while the melancholy boding Raven, from the hollow oak or ivy-mantled turret, gave to the blast his harsh discordant notes."</QuotesOther> It was on such a night, when <QuotesOther>"distressed damsels are rescued by valorous Knights, or some terrific spectral form is seen slow stalking with noiseless pace,"</QuotesOther> there was no grove, no Nightingale, no purling rill, or rolling orb of night: but the melancholy voice of the hoarse watchman, who yawned the midnight hour, and the noise of the rain as it poured down the gutters.

<Trigger>At length</Trigger> a coach stopped, and in

#79#

glided Emily to the parlour where Miss Fordyce was sitting: but ah! how changed from what she was when she last saw her ! Her lovely eyes were red and swollen with weeping, her cheeks were pale, and her dress in disorder. Miss Fordyce was astonished at her appearance.

<DiaM>“Good heavens!” <M>said she,</M>> "my dear Miss Henderson, what is the matter with you; are you not well; what has happened?”</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nothing,” <M>faintly sighed Emily,</M> — "I am not very well: we were caught in the rain — Stanly had a quarrel — and---------"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"A quarrel! what, on your account? Oh! that is so romantic,” <M>said Miss Fordyce,</M> "but pray tell me all about it. How did he behave; did he fight bravely; how many did he wound; was it banditti that attacked him?”</DiaM>

Miss Fordyce was now all anxiety to

hear the adventures which, she had ho doubt, was similar to some she had read in romances, but was greatly disappointed to find that the parties concerned were only a drunken Lord and a Commoner equally so; who, as Emily said, <FIDquotes>"would not let them pass quietly through the streets.”</FIDquotes>

<DiaM>"Oh! is that all ?” <M>returned Miss Fordyce</M>: "however, I suppose there will be a duel; and that will be in all the newspapers. What pleasure I shall take in reading the account, particularly as I shall be able to know the meaning of the initials; for Stanly will tell you all about it.”</DiaM>

<DiaM>“You forget” <M>said Emily, in a still fainter voice,</M> "that the life of Stanly will be endangered.”</DiaM>

<DiaInsetNarraitve>"Endangered! There you are wrong. Why, my dear girl, a duel is the most harmless thing in the world; for instance, a desperate quarrel takes place

between two gentlemen, in some public place of entertainment, as the Opera, or Vauxhall; perhaps about a Lady, whom neither of the parties care one fig for: after the usual conversation, such as, Sir, you’re no gentleman, — Sir, I insist on immediate satisfaction, — Sir, you’re an impertinent puppy, — cards are exchanged, and both the hero’s strut away looking as big as turkey cocks — the wonder and admiration of the Ladies, and the theme of everyone’s conversation, a challenge is then sent, which is probably couched in these terms. —"

<QuotesOther>"Sir, Your conduct this evening being such as it is impossible for a gentleman to put up with, I beg to acquaint you that I shall be precisely at six o’clock waiting your arrival at Chalk Farm. Your informing the bearer what weapons you prefer, and whether <i>you</i> wish particularly to bring

a surgeon, will be esteemed a favor by, Sir, your most obedient servant.”</QuotesOther> "I am afraid,” <M>continued Miss Fordyce, who was evidently endeavouring to rally Emily out of her melancholy mood,</M> "I am afraid that I have been rather hasty with my letter; for, through fear of accidents, an anonymous one is very often sent,before the challenge, to Bow Street, in order to request the interference of the Peace Officers in an unfortunate quarrel between two gentlemen of family, &c. stating the time they are to meet, taking care that it should be at least half an hour before that appointed, that they might be sure of being there to prevent the loss of powder and ball, the Gentlemen then return very amicably to Bow Street, where, having given security for their pacific conduct, than which nothing is more easy to obtain, they go to their homes

in great content with the events of the morning; perfectly satisfied with each other as being men of honor, and so forth: or it should happen that no friend should have warned the Magistrates of their hostile intents, and they should meet, and, on casting their eyes around see no hopes of succor, they then discharge their pistols, whose deadly contents are a little powder and a roll of paper, which sings harmless through the air: the seconds then interfere, and endeavour to reconcile the difference, when, with what rapture do the two mortal combatants rush into each other’s arms: they weep for joy, and love each other ever after dearer than their own existence. Indeed duels now are getting out of fashion; for the very apprentices, aping the great, have been known to borrow a horse-pistol, and sally forth to fight, accommodating each other alternately with the said

pistol: 'till having spent all their powder and ball, to the great comfort of the birds, they contrive to get their meeting inserted in the public prints: nay; it is even an undoubted fact, that two authors, burning with heroic ardor to engage with other weapons than pen and paper, not long ago agreed io meet: scarcely, however, had the challenge been sent when the parties changed their mind, and the two seconds met each other at Bow Street, where, according to the instructions given them, they had been sent to warn the Officers to attend. Struck with sudden shame, both of them faced to the right about without performing their errand: and the next morning the heros were opposed to each other. After waiting some time in anxious expectation of the arrival of the Officers, who, each concluded, had been sent for, one of them suddenly recollected

that he bad not made his will, and heroically desired to write a few lines on the field of combat. Pen, ink, and paper being produced, he sat down and began his task which, however, took him an extraordinary length of time; though all he had to leave was a manuscript which had been greased by half the hands of the booksellers in town, and sent back with the mortifying words, that they had more manuscripts than they could print in two years; that their hands were full, or tied up; or the subject was not new; or the price too much; or the author not known; or they had lost a great deal by similar works. I say," <M>continued the voluble Miss Fordyce,</M> "the unhappy author, finding that the men never came, at last pretended he could not recollect certain circumstances which it was necessary he should, in order to make a proper dis-

tribution of his property, and determined to defer the meeting to the next morning, e’er which both parties being thoroughly convinced that they had only mistaken each other, were reconciled, and became better friends than ever: such are modern duels. So you need have no fears respecting Stanly’s safety, my dear Emily; therefore cheer up your spirits: depend upon it, the quarrel, whatever it was, will have an amicable termination.”</DiaInsetNarraitve>

Emily, in spite of the deep sorrow of her heart, could not help once or twice smiling at her description of duels; and, like a drowning person who seizes at a straw for support, endeavoured to think that it really was as her friend had told her; and that she need be under no apprehensions about her lover: her own situation indeed agonized her bursting heart sufficiently, without any new cause of

#87#

misery: and it being now near one o’clock, she took leave of her friend and was drove home in the coach.</SceneDia>

Fortunately for Emily both Mr. and Mrs. Henderson had retired to rest: she was therefore spared the pain of meeting them, when she was so ill able to support the examination of her mother-in-law’s looks, in which she thought her shame was legibly depicted.

<Exclamation>What a night did the unfortunate victim of seduction pass!</Exclamation> She counted every hour; listened to the melancholy ticking of her watch, and ruminated on the past with such increasing mournful anticipations, that at times her senses almost seemed on the point of forsaking her; and she would start up in her bed clasping her hands in all the agony of unutterable woe — So passed the livelong night.

<Apostrophe>Stanly, hadst thou but seen the sorrows of thy victim, hadst thou beheld

her features, where so late blossomed the roseate tints of health, now pale; those eyes that once glowed with all the fire of love, swolen with tears; those lips, once so red, and which, when opened, gave passage to her balmy breath, now blanched by her frequent sighs; how it would have increased the horrors of conscience which, in spite of the recollection of the past blissful moments, sunk deep in thy guilty bosom ! Cruel man; thou hast opened the gates of misery to the lovely woman, who, believing thee endued with honour and sincerity, withheld not her dearest treasure; gave to thee herself, her heart, her person, all she had to bestow; seduced by thy promises of becoming united to her in the sight of Heaven and the world.</Apostrophe>

But though Stanly was troubled by unpleasant reflections, yet there remained a secret gratification which

#89#

fluttered round his heart, at his having succeeded in his schemes: and as marriage was only a word, a mere agent, which he made use of in order to forward his plans, so now that he had gained his point, he dismissed it from his recollection: determined, however, to amuse Emily, from time to time, with fond hopes, in order to continue in the gratification of his passion as long as his fickle disposition would allow him; and then to seek some reason to abandon her for ever.

Such, with sorrow do <AuthorWe>we</AuthorWe> mention it, had been Stanly's plan before; but his victims had been more fortunate in the events of their lives: for none of them experienced such acute, such agonizing sensations, as now racked the bosom of Emily; whose heart, tenderly alive to sensibility, was ill able to endure the calamities which awaited her; and which it is the fate of <Book>these pages</Book>
