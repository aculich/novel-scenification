<ChapMarker>CHAP. I.</ChapMarker>

<ChBioIntro>Maria Maynard was the favourite of man, woman, and child; and had one signal token of being a favourite of Heaven; for <QuotedLit>“whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.”</QuotedLit>

In early infancy she was deprived of her mother. A few years afterwards, the only sister of her father, devotedly attached to his child, took her, With his concurrence, to London, from her paternal residence in Wales, for the purpose of adding to the graces of nature, the elegances and accomplishments of polished life. During this absence from her home, which was of long continuance, her father died: — in a few years afterwards, and at the very crisis when her heart, mind, person, and manners, had realized the fondest hopes of her maternal friend, this tender relation was likewise taken from her; but not before she had bequeathed to her a legacy, in addition to the moderate inheritance which she had derived from her father. This bequest conferred not affluence, it is true, but it was all that the testatrix held in her own disposal.

And now, the wishes of the lovely and dejected orphan pointed to her native home, which she still remembered with yearning affection; and, although it was robbed of her father’s presence, there still remained upon the spot a dear and intimate companion of her childhood, a <ChNameIntro>.Miss Amyand</ChNameIntro>, who, with her mother, resided in the neighbourhood. Miss Maynard was urgently solicited to be their inmate, and with them, she, now in her twentieth year, gladly consented to take up her abode.</ChBioIntro>

At no great distance from the house of Mrs. Amyand, and on a small estate in a most romantic situation, lived <ChNameIntro>Mr. Villiers</ChNameIntro>, and his son;—a son, who was at once the delight of his father, and the admiration of all that knew him. The families were already in the habit of visiting each other, and the lapse of a few months increased their acquaintance to intimacy. An attachment grew, and daily strengthened, between <ChNameIntro>Edmund Villiers</ChNameIntro>, and Maria Maynard. The elder Mr. Villiers, with much of paternal tenderness, had something of the paternal pride which that tenderness too frequently inspires; the first effect of which had been an indulgence of the early, and ardent passion of his boy for military pursuits, — pursuits which originated rather in the enthusiastic interest he took in the history of ancient wars, than in his personal knowledge of the heroes of modern times. By the self-same pride, however, was the father now impelled to oppose the still more fervent passion of his son for his lovely neighbour, on whom, though all the gifts of nature were exhausted, those of fortune were, as we have seen, but sparingly bestowed. For two whole years, this opposition was continued; but the duteous struggles of a darling, and disappointed son, and the distinguished merits, and engaging manners, of Maria Maynard, at length overcame the resistance of the father. His full consent obtained, they were married; and, for twelve short months, were happy. Scarcely were those months expired, when the noble Edmund, who, by close attention to his profession, had risen to the colonelcy of his regiment, at the age of eight-and-twenty, was ordered to the East Indies.

His tender wife, who had recently become a mother also, sickened with sad forebodings at the news. The infant daughter which she cradled in her arms, had made her doubly a coward: she felt too surely that she was not a heroine, yet remembered that she was still a Christian; and that though, as a mother, she might tremble, yet, as a mother, she must resolve to act. He saw, and shared her struggles; and thus, with bursting hearts, and anguish ill suppressed, they parted.

Deep, and silent was the grief of the father at the separation; and long was the interval, before either the tenderness of his daughter-in-law, who, from this time, quitted him no more, or the daily opening smiles of intelligence in the countenance of her child, could bring him comfort. <SceneOther>At length, in the second year of his son’s absence, and just as he was again beginning to taste of hope, a newspaper, in which was recorded a battle against a powerful Nabob, in the interior parts of India, concluded its melancholy tale with a list of the officers who had fallen. In that list he had barely power to read the name of Edmund Villiers.

This stroke, which his parental anxiety had too often anticipated as probable, was not, on that account, the less severe. For a time, it left him stunned — but the sight of his poor Maria, who <Trigger>now</Trigger> came smiling into the room, unconscious of the coming blow, while it thrilled to his heart, irresistibly called on him to forget, if possible, himself in her. Instantly did she perceive that something had shaken him to the centre. A moment afterwards, he desired her to sit beside him; and, summoning at once the remaining energies of his mind, he tenderly prepared her for the wound he was enforced to give. She rivetted her aching eyes on his, as he proceeded through his mournful task; and when the dreaded truth was all unfolded, convulsively clasped her hands, and dropped lifeless at his feet!</SceneOther> A few days afterwards, the heavy tidings were too well confirmed by a letter from one of the surviving officers, which told of Edmund’s noble deeds, and honourable death; honourable in itself, and so felt, so welcomed, by him on whom it fell; for, to this account it was subjoined, that, while he lay, still bleeding, on the field, he was overheard faintly repeating to himself, —

<QuotedLit>“Dulce et decorum est pro patriâ mori.”</QuotedLit>

<Exclamation>The same fatal epistle enclosed to the wretched widow, from his own dying hand, his last farewell!</Exclamation>

<QuotedLit>"Long were to tell”</QuotedLit> what was endured of bitter grief, by the unhappy father, and heart-wounded wife. The sufferings of the former were shortened by a more advanced age; and infirmities, increased by sorrow, soon released him from the load of life. This second stroke, while again it smote the heart of Maria, seemed, yet, to bring with it one alleviation, — that of freeing her from the cruel duty of exerting her own broken spirits in unavailing efforts to support those of her father and friend: she, accordingly, resigned herself, with a mournful satisfaction, to the full indulgence of her grief. Her father-in-law had left her his estate, together with the house which they had inhabited. There, for three long years, did she continue to shut herself from all who would have approached to comfort her. General condolences she dreaded to receive; and Miss Amyand, already mentioned as her most intimate friend, and whose marriage had taken place within a short period of her own, had, with her mother and husband, left the kingdom.

At length, the improving stature of the little Helena, and the idea that her infant mind would soon require an instructor, and a guide, roused her from the lethargy of grief, and she awoke to thought, to action, and, at last, to hope. She resolved to look towards the future for her child, and, in her child, for herself. She admitted the few associates afforded by her retirement, as feeling that they would be conducive to the amusement of her Helena, and were almost essential to the expansion of her mind, as well as the ease of her manners.

She now devoted herself, with exemplary constancy, to the welfare of this beloved child, and contemplated, with a mother’s interest, the effects of her growing graces on her admiring friends; — though oftentimes the kindling smile was quenched in tears, as the image of Edmund rushed upon her mind, and she mused on the delight with which the father would have watched those graces, and advanced them to maturity. Great, however, was the rapidity of this advancement; and the mind thus anxiously treasured, was enclosed in a casket altogether worthy of the jewel within. Certainly, the beauty of Helena was of a kind, and degree, that could not but be highly flattering to the fond ambition of a mother.

<ChPortrait>To draw the picture of the pretty Helena would task alike the pen, or pencil. Nature, though she gave her to be "baptized in tears,” endowed her with a vivacity and versatility of character, which were eloquent in her countenance; and when that countenance was lighted up with smiles, it shone like a sun-beam on her, mother's heart. But the peculiar spirit which informed her beauty we will leave to manifest itself as we proceed: — the surface of it was not far from this: — her eye was the very azure of the heavens: — it was a long eye; — large it was not — nor certainly was it small: — neither its size, nor form, however, could have been other than they were, without injury to the face which it illumined. It was naturally a lively eye; but when the long, dark, silken lashes that overshadowed it, were bathed with the drops of pity, or of penitence for the little sins of childhood, so tender was its look, that Carlo Dolce might have transplanted it to the face of a weeping Magdalene. Her complexion was distinguished for the rosy brilliancy of its tints, and soft was the satin on which those tints were laid; while the general effect of her countenance was heightened by the auburn curls which clustered round it. Her nose was of that subtly rising contour, which exhibited a turn peculiarly adapted to a face of animation, and absolutely appropriated to her face. Her mouth was yet more difficult to delineate than all the rest — attended as it was by a playful dimple or two, which appeared, and disappeared, with every varying feeling. Add to all a sylph-like figure, and the prettiest hands and feet in the world, and you have Helena before you, as nearly as I can present her, such as she was, her mother’s idol, at ten years old; — for so much time has stolen away, while she has been learning to read, and work, and write; besides having made a very considerable progress in the rudiments of French, drawing, and music; in all of which it was the business and delight of her accomplished mother, to be her sole instructress.</ChPortrait> From this time, she proposed to herself great, and important assistance in the culture of her daughter’s understanding, by the kindness of a neighbour, who held the highest place in her preference and good opinion — the rector of the village she inhabited — <ChPortrait>Mr. Melcombe. This gentleman was a younger son of a noble family: his education bad been worthy of his birth; and he had reaped from both, those bright advantages which equally qualified him for retirement, and for the world; while, happily, from his high connexions he had obtained a Living, together with a large addition to his fortune, while he had youth and health to give them value. He had pow been in possession of his benefice for several years; discharging his sacred functions in a manner that commanded equally the love, and he veneration of all — <QuotedLit>"high and low, rich and poor.”</QuotedLit>

<QuotedLit>“By him, the violated law spoke out
Its thunders; and by him, in strains as sweet
As angels use, the gospel whisper’d peace.”</QuotedLit>

He was religious, without a taint of bigotry; and, what was still more rarely meritorious, without a spark of animosity against the bigotted. With such, he would sometimes reason; and if they were gloomy and despairing, he would pity, but he never scorned them. Charitable he was, in every import of the word. He was profoundly learned too; yet thought it necessary, as well as felt it natural, to be perfectly well-bred. With all these perfections, at the age of six-and-thirty, he was still unwedded; but whether by choice, or fate, was not surmised.</ChPortrait>

At the period of which we are now speaking, this exalted Character had under his friendly charge a certain Youth, whose father, while he was himself amassing a fortune for him in India, had left him, in his childhood, to the protection of Mr. Melcombe, the chosen companion of his early days. <ChNameIntro>Frederick Beaumont</ChNameIntro> was, at this period, thirteen years of age, and stood very high, in character and situation, at Eton school. No time was lost in his vacations; for they were passed in reading, walking, riding, and conversing, with his beloved instructor and friend. His gayer hours were spent, for the most part, in frolicking with Helena, in her mother’s garden. Sometimes, too, he would assist her improvements in drawing, in which he had, himself, made very considerable advances; but his greatest delight was in riding by her side with Mr. Melcombe, who was just beginning to teach her to hold her bridle, and sit a pretty little snow-white poney, which, at this time, was her newest and favourite plaything. Mr. Melcombe was extravagantly fond of her, and when she paced, and prattled along, between himself and Frederick, it was difficult to say which looked the happiest of the three. Now and then, when she was more inclined to laugh with Frederick, than attend to her horse, the grave preceptor would pretend to scold, and tell her to mind her bridle, or he would not take her out another time.

<SceneAction><DiaM>"O yes you will, Sir;" <M>said she, <trigger>one day</trigger></M>, "and, besides, I know you and Frederick will take care of me: — as for him, if poney does but trip the least in the world, he is always ten times more frightened than I am.”</DiaM>

<Dia>"But what could I, or even <i>Frederick</i> do, should Frolick run away with you ? He is but a foolish Frolick, and if we were to pursue him, would only scamper away the faster; and if you should fall off, and break your little neck, what would become of poor mamma ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"O my pretty mamma! — well, now I will be very good indeed, if you will but put the bridle right once more.”</Dia>

Frederick was <FIDquotes>"sure <i>he</i> could do that;"</FIDquotes> —but before he had time to take hold of it, Frolick, with a sudden nod, had twitched it out of her hand. It fell, and entangled his foot, which both incommoded and alarmed him, and he began to wheel about, still treading on the bridle, and appearing to be every moment ready to fall, with his trembling little rider, to the ground; but Frederick, who in an instant had dismounted, seized his foot, and while Mr. Melcombe took charge of Helena, disentangled the bridle, and set poney on his legs again; — but, colouring with terror at what might have happened, cried out —

<DiaQ>"Helena, Helena, why did you let it go ?”</DiaQ> — She mounted again with great composure, saying,

<DiaQ>"So! now you are going to scold!”</DiaQ> At last, all was adjusted, and they rode peaceably on to Mrs. Villiers’s house, where she was anxiously watching for them at the parlour window. Mr. Melcombe took Helena from her steed with the greatest care, gave her an affectionate kiss, and away she ran to her mamma.</SceneAction>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. II.</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia>On the following morning, Mrs. Villiers, having spent some hours in the instruction of Helena, dismissed her to her amusements in the garden: and Helena, <trigger>perceiving</trigger> an <ChNoNameIntro>old man</ChNoNameIntro> who was frequently employed to work in it, and with whom she had formed the <i>strictest friendship</i>, was presently at his side. She would often stand near him, watching him at his occupation, and asking him a hundred pretty questions, which he was ever ready to answer, and sometimes would she busily employ herself, under his directions, and delight in fancying that she was of prodigious use to him in his labours. She had been thus engaged for about an hour, while Mrs. Villiers had been sitting at her work. Helena entered —

<DiaQ>"Pray, mamma, what sort of a place is London ?”</DiaQ>

<Dia>"A large question, Helena: perhaps you may see one day or other; but what put London in your head just now ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"Why, mamma, old Bernard says it’s the D—l’s Country — naughty word you know! — he says he saw him there, and told me a great deal about it; it’s a very pretty story, mamma; do, let him tell it you himself.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Old Bernard talks nonsense; — but my dear child, how you have heated yourself! what have you been about ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"Hard at work, mamma, helping old Bernard.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Well, now, go and take off your bonnet, and then come and help me; — for I am tired of this hearth-rug, and want it finished.”</Dia>

Away she flew, but <ItalicsOther><i>flew</i></ItalicsOther> not back. Mrs. Villiers began to wonder what was become of her. At last she appeared.

<Dia>"What have you been doing all this time, Helena ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"Curling my hair nice, mamma. Old Bernard said it was very pretty; so, I was looking at it in the glass, and I quite forgot you were waiting for me.”</Dia>

<Dia>"What should old Bernard know about hair, child ? do sit down, and shade that flower as I have done this.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Yes, mamma.”</Dia>

At that moment entered Frederick, with his arm full of new books.

<Dia>"O mamma, look at Frederick!”</Dia> — He approached, and, with whimsical gravity, dropped on one knee to Helena, and, tottering, presented the books,

<DiaQ>"With Mr. Melcombe’s duty to Miss Villiers.”</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"How kind is Mr. Melcombe!” <M>said Mrs. Villiers.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Mr. Melcombe’s <i>duty</i> to <i>me</i>, mamma!”</Dia> <Descriptor>— and she laughed, and chuckled, for a minute</Descriptor>; and then, with assumed dignity, befitting the occasion, prepared to receive them graciously: when Frederick, having lost his gravity, — and his balance, tumbled them all on the floor. Not being in a sedate mood, he made another overset in picking them up — saying,

<DiaQ>"I am as awkward as Lord Chesterfield’s awkward man."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Does Mr. Melcombe let you read Lord Chesterfield ?” <M>asked Mrs. Villiers</M> --</DiaM>

<Dia>"Only a selection, Ma’am: he says I must not read the letters through — there they are, and I never see them but my fingers ache to pull them down.”</Dia>

<Dia>"But you never do, I am sure, Frederick.”</Dia> —

<DiaM>“No, Ma'am,” <M>said Frederick, emphatically, and a little proudly</M>: "but was it not rather odd, Ma’am, for Lord Chesterfield to write to his son, what I must not read?”</DiaM>

<DiaM>“I think it was, Frederick, and so thought a greater man than either of us,” <M>said Mrs. Villiers laughing — and opening a volume of Cowper's poems, which lay on the table, she pointed out to him those beautiful lines which begin thus: —

<QuotedLit>"Petronius! all the muses weep for thee,
But ev’ry tear shall scald thy memory.
The Graces, too, while Virtue at their shrine
Lay bleeding under that soft hand of thine,
Felt each a mortal stab in her own breast,
Abhorr’d the sacrifice, and curs’d the priest.” &c. &c.</QuotedLit></M>

"Do not forget them, Frederick, they will serve you as an antidote to Lord Chesterfield’s poison.”</DiaM>

Helena was lost in all the books. They were "Goldsmith’s Natural History,” and "L’Ami des Enfans.” A volume of the latter was in her hand —

<Dia>"O mamma, may Frederick read one of these stories to us ?”</Dia>

Mrs. Villiers — laughing — <Dia>"You should ask Frederick’s leave before mine, I think, Helena.”</Dia> — <Dia>"O, <i>he</i> will, I know; — won’t you, Frederick ?”</Dia>

He read. The story was interesting. Mrs. Villiers cast a side-glance at the flower: — it was spoiled. Helena was reproved for carelessness; — she received the reproof with looks of humility, and promises of immediate reparation; and Mrs. Villiers told her, that, as she was so penitent, she might lay aside her work, for the present, and attend to Frederick.

<Dia>"What’s being penitent, mamma ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"I will tell you another time; but Frederick’s hours are precious; if he is to read, let him go on.”</Dia>

He did so — and when he had ended the tale and was taking his departure, Helena loaded him with a thousand thanks, and loves, to Mr. Melcombe, for his <FIDquotes>"beautiful present.”</FIDquotes>

<Dia>"But before you go, Frederick, mind, you have not put the moss upon my geraniums: — go, and do it now.”</Dia>

<DiaM>"Helena!” — <M>said Mrs. Villiers</M>, "is Frederick your slave ?”</DiaM>

<Dia>"I shall do it, she knows:"</Dia> — <Descriptor>and away he went, to do as he was bidden</Descriptor>. A little lecture ensued from mamma, on <FIDquotes>"speaking prettily;"</FIDquotes> with an explanation of penitence, and some general observations on humility of deportment.</SceneDia>

To her mother, Helena was a model of obedience — to others, most particularly to the domestics, if they ever ventured to find fault with her, she would sometimes stand <i>higher</i> than mamma thought becoming; but this pride brought on its own humiliation; for Mrs. Villiers never failed to oblige her to make concessions to all whom she had hurt or offended.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. III.</ChapMarker>

Mr. Melcombe was an early riser, and very solicitous that Frederick should follow his example.

<SceneDia>Frederick did his best, but high spirits, and much exercise, occasioned him to sleep very soundly; and a few mornings after the incidents related in the last chapter, he was in profound repose at eight o’clock, <Trigger>when</Trigger> Mr. Melcombe entered his apartment, — and called out, <DiaQ>"Frederick! what, sleeping still ? old Homer and I have been waiting for you this hour, you rogue, and we have wounded Venus, and laid waste the plain, without your assistance; for I opened the book where I should have read with you, and was so entranced with it, that I could not lay it down; but come, make haste, and I will fight all the battle o’er again with you before breakfast, yet.”</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Yes, Sir,” <M>yawned Frederick, — and he rubbed his eyes, and begged pardon.</M></DiaM> Mr. Melcombe left him, <Blend>and</Blend> he was soon in the study at his side. Frederick, though a very young Grecian, began already to taste the sublimity of the language, and when he had made himself master of a favourite passage, delighted to repeat it, and dwell on the musical and majestic effect of the words, and the varied cadences of the verse. He would perserve the full force of the sentiment, or description, by an energy of utterance, and richness of intonation, which were truly gratifying to Mr. Melcombe, who was himself a fine reader, as well as an enthusiast in poetry, and had taken great pains in giving his pupil the proper emphasis. Other requisites of good reading, he knew, could be conferred by nature alone, and he was well pleased to observe that the combination was complete.

<Dia>"I think, Sir, there is a great deal of dignity in the sullenness of Achilles. He is a proud, passionate fellow; but, somehow, I cannot help liking him, for all that.”</Dia>

<Dia>"He has a great many faults; but I am rather of opinion that Homer could not help liking him neither, Frederick; — for he has thrown about him a lustre that is irresistible: then, he has made him courteous, affectionate, and, in one instance, compassionate.

<QuotedLit>"When Priam kneel’d, the great Achilles wept.”</QuotedLit>

"But as you have read the Iliad in the second edition of Cowper’s translation, which gives perhaps the closest idea of the original that our language is capable of giving, you are not now to learn that Achilles was selfish in his anger, and ungenerous in his revenge. That he was ill-used by Agamemnon, is indisputable; but, it would have well become Achilles, to have sacrificed his own wrongs to the cause in which he was engaged; more particularly, as he did not profess to be very deeply attached to Briseïs: but, though he saw that the long ten years’ war was drawing to a crisis at which he alone could decide it in favour of Greece, he suffered his princely companions in battle to implore, and his friends to kneel, in vain; till the death of Patroclus called him to revenge. — Then — but though I do not love him, Frederick, I respect him too much to dwell on his words, and his actions, when the noble Hector fell.”</Dia>

<Dia>"O no, don’t talk of all that, Sir; but, — What a brave fellow he was! — Was not he as brave as Alexander the Great, Sir ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"Doubtless, he was; but <i>Hector</i> is <i>my</i> hero; though I see that he will not be yours these dozen years; and, possibly, not then. Now let us go to breakfast; and then to Virgil; and then — for a ramble on the mountains.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Shall we call on Mrs. Villiers as we come home, Sir ?”</Dia>

Mr. Melcombe did not answer for four or five seconds.

<Dia>"No; not to-day, Frederick; we have been there very often of late, and you have lost a little too much time in gardening with Helena.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Dear thing! she is so happy when I work for her in her own garden, and teach her to nurse plants and flowers!”</Dia>

<Dia>"She is a sweet little creature — though she will not have <i>quite</i> the feminine softness, and graceful dignity, of her mother.”</Dia>

<Dia>"O I <i>do</i> love <i>her</i>, too! — don’t you Sir ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"My <i>dear</i> boy, we will go to-morrow.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Thank you Sir.”</Dia>

Mr. Melcombe had no more inclination to abate the frequency of their visits, than Frederick; but had more reasons for proposing this delay than he chose to assign.</SceneDia>

"To-morrow” came. <SceneDia>Frederick rose earlier: the morning engagements were all fulfilled in good time, and the tutor and pupil went together to Mrs. Villiers’s. <Trigger>It was a beautiful, soft, summer day</Trigger>; and, after the first greetings, they all adjourned to the garden. The young ones scampered away to look after their flowers, and Mr. Melcombe and Mrs. Villiers walked quietly after them.

<Dia>"That's a charming boy, Mr. Melcombe!”</Dia>

<Dia>"Indeed he is, Madam — every thing I can wish; for he has no more of human frailty than just shews that he is — not an angel; and has a warmth of heart, and vigour of understanding, that give me every thing to hope for.”</Dia>

<Dia>"How happy is Mr. Beaumont, at the distance to which he is banished from his Son, in having confided him to such a Friend, and such an Instructor! I sometimes think — that — when he is gone to school, and you are more at leisure, I shall be half tempted to solicit your assistance in tutoring my giddy one, who is, now and then, a little too volatile for my spirits.”</Dia>

<Dia>“You both honour, and flatter me, Madam; and, although there is nothing she ought to know which you are not fully qualified to teach, yet, to save you any exertion which might be too pressing on your spirits, and still more to share with you the interesting task of enlightening such a mind, will be a happiness that I did not — dared not — I mean, that would afford me the sincerest pleasure, and gratification.”</Dia>

Mrs. Villiers thanked him; but there was a something in his manner that surprised her, and made her a little repent that she had made this proposition; — and, she said no more.

Mr. Melcombe, however, pursued the subject, and, from whatever motive he had proposed to himself to slacken his visits, the present occasion appeared to him to dictate the necessity of increasing their frequency. He informed Mrs. Villiers that Frederick had made some progress in geography; but that it would be an indulgence both to Frederick, and himself, to be permitted, for Helena’s benefit, to run through their lessons once more; and he begged to be allowed to set apart, for this purpose, two mornings in every week, on which they should come to her house at any convenient hour. He concluded, by entreating that they might begin on the following day. Mrs. Villiers was silent.

<Dia>"<i>Why</i>, my dear Madam, do you now hesitate ?"</Dia>

She felt it must appear strange that she did so — and felt, too, that she had in fact no assignable reason for retracting her wish: — again she thanked him; and it was settled, that, on the next morning, they should begin their lectures.</SceneDia>

Helena had an insatiable thirst for every species of information; and when she heard the arrangement, was in ecstacies — <SpeechInsert>"Learn geography, Mamma! and of Mr. Melcombe! and with Frederick!"</SpeechInsert>

<SceneAction><Trigger>The next day,</Trigger> the lessons commenced in Mrs. Villiers’s dressing-room — an elegant little apartment, overlooking the garden, to which descended a small flight of steps. Beyond that, lay a meadow, where the white poney ranged by the side of a river, flowing through a country that might flatter the imagination of an enthusiast with the ideas of the Vale of Tempé, or the Groves of Paradise.

When the lesson was over, the whole party repaired again to the garden. Helena had been attentive, and had leave to gambol without restraint. She was soon in full flight round the walks; and Frederick, like a young Apollo, close behind her. In a few minutes afterward, he was pulling, up hill, at a large rolling-stone, with his utmost strength. On the lower ground, in the same walk, with her head averted from her play-fellow, stood Helena, in deep meditation on a beautiful caterpillar which she had just picked up. Frederick, while endeavouring to secure his hold of the handle, let it suddenly slip from his grasp, and the roller ran rapidly down the walk.

Mrs. Villiers, seeing Helena’s situation, uttered a shriek of terror. Mr. Melcombe was by her side: — she staggered — he, in a moment, extended his arms; and caught her, fainting, as she fell. Frederick was calling out to Helena, with all the strength of his voice,

<Dia>"Away — away from the roller"</Dia> — <Descriptor>and waving his hand to hasten her.</Descriptor>

She had turned at the rumbling of the stone, and the shriek of her mother; and had skipped off on a flower-bed, while the roller passed violently by. Frederick ran up to her, and, gently slapping her cheek, cried out —

<DiaQ>"Why, Helena, how dare you frighten me so ?”</DiaQ>

<Dia>"How dare you make me jump upon those two beautiful carnations? There! I have broke both their necks.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Never mind the carnations, my dear little girl; I thought I had killed you!”</Dia> — <Descriptor>and he gasped, and panted, and, trying to laugh, fairly sobbed upon her shoulder.</Descriptor> They now turned up the walk.

<DiaM>"Hol—-lo” — cried Frederick, still trembling, "What’s the matter with Mrs. Villiers ?”</DiaM>

<Dia>"Where? what? — Mamma! — where?"</Dia>

Mr. Melcombe was supporting her to the house — Frederick flew to assist, and Helena flew after him, crying,

<DiaQ>"Mamma, dear mamma! I am quite well: — the roller did not hurt me — pray, pray, look up at me!”</DiaQ>

They placed her on a sofa, and by proper assistance she was soon recovered. The sight of Helena’s sorrowful face gave a turn to her feelings, and she was relieved, by a shower of tears. She then smiled, and nodded at her darling, who wept, kissed her, and begged forgiveness, all in a breath. When the children were again dismissed, Mr. Melcombe sat down by Mrs. Villiers, and taking her hand with the tenderest respect in both his own, asked, in a tone of trembling anxiety,

<DiaQ>"How are you now ?”</DiaQ>

<Dia>“Better—much better, I thank you — this child makes quite a simpleton of me. How much trouble I have given you!”</Dia>

<Dia>“Trouble! — my dear Friend, I would give half my existence to save you one moment’s pain.”</Dia> -- <DescriptorQ>He paused; then, fixing his eyes on hers, he ended</DescriptorQ> --- <DiaQ>"to contribute to your happiness, would be well worth my whole life’s solicitude.”</DiaQ>

Mrs. Villiers shook her head —

<Dia>"I thank your zeal — your kindness, Sir, a thousand times; — but happiness and I have quarrelled for many a year; and, in this world, we shall meet no more.”</Dia>

Mr. Melcombe shuddered.-—The <ItalicsOther>"<i>Sir</i>,"</ItalicsOther> at such a moment, and the tone of it, struck cold to his heart; and the melancholy winding up of the sentence told him all he had to dread. He sat, with his head thrown backward on the sofa, in perfect silence, for some minutes. Mrs. Villiers had not courage to add another word; but each well knew what was passing in the mind of the other.

The voices, and feet, of the young ones, were now heard on the steps from the garden; and Mr. Melcombe, dreading the sight of the children, yet not daring to prevent their approach, started up, and, pressing the hand of Mrs. Villiers, could only say, <DiaQ>“God bless you!”</DiaQ> — in a voice of deep expression, and <ArrivalDeparture>rushed out</ArrivalDeparture> at the opposite door.

<DiaM>"Where’s Mr. Melcombe ?” <M>cried the children, both in a breath.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"I believe he is gone home."</Dia>

<DiaM>"What, without me!” <M>said Frederick,</M> "and has left no message ?”</DiaM>

<Dia>"No, — perhaps he will come in again — I don’t know.”</Dia>

He came no more; and, when the dinner hour drew near, Frederick returned home, and found that Mr. Melcombe had walked out, and left word that he was not to be expected at dinner.</SceneAction>

Frederick was disappointed, — took a short repast, and calling Tiger, Mr. Melcombe’s favourite Newfoundland dog, who, he was surprised to find, had not followed his master, as usual, set out on a long range over the mountains, in search of wild shrubs, goats, and cataracts.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. IV.</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia>Frederick did not return ’till dusk. He met Mr. Melcombe looking out for him.

<Dia>"O Sir, I am glad to see you: — I lost you at Mrs. Villiers’s, and concluded I should find you at home, but, — but —"</Dia> <Descriptor>and Frederick, who, though gay and thoughtless, was full of delicacy, felt that he was taking a liberty by seeming to inquire where Mr. Melcombe had been.</Descriptor>

<Dia>"Very particular circumstances occasioned me to go out for the remainder of the day.”</Dia>

<Dia>"You look tired, Sir: — let me prevail on you to take a little supper, and a glass of wine, to-night.”</Dia>

Mr. Melcombe let Frederick do what be pleased with him; and as, in truth, he had dined no where, the proposal was not altogether unpleasant to him. He had left home, to avoid the constraint of Frederick’s company, and wandered about all day, in the vain hope of escaping from himself. Frederick was all activity, and solicitude, in ordering and contriving a refreshing repast for his respected Friend, and anxiously exerted all his powers to cheer and amuse him. At no other moment would such attentions have been lost on Mr. Melcombe — but, lost they were. He tried, indeed, to smile at Frederick’s gaiety, and to meet his advances towards conversation; but the effort was vain, and soon after the cloth was removed,

<DiaM>"My dear boy,” <M>said he</M>, "you are very attentive to me, and very kind; but, I am not very well, nor very gay; and I think I shall be better for a good night’s rest.”</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I hope you will have it, Sir, with all my heart” — <M>said Frederick</M>.</DiaM>

Mr. Melcombe, once more alone, hoped for nothing <ItalicsOther><i>less</i></ItalicsOther> than a good night’s rest.</SceneDia> Few as had been the words of Mrs. Villiers, he felt them to be conclusive; and the more so, as they accorded but too well with some general observations which he had heard from her on second marriages; and also with other distant, but expressive, allusions to her own feelings; all of which had kept him silent on this most interesting subject, though for a long, long period it had engaged his thoughts. He also felt that Mrs. Villiers was not a woman to resolve rashly, or relent weakly; and, unfortunately, the more he honoured her constancy, the more he loved her; — and he had loved her, though she guessed it not, for years before they had been accidentally associated in their present retirement. During her residence in the metropolis, he had frequently met her — admired, loved, and sighed for her: but, having at that time no benefice, and but a slender fortune, he would not seek to wed her to his poverty; but, generously suppressed his wishes, and was, soon after, overwhelmed with the tidings of her marriage.

As circumstances now stood, he feared to renew the hints which, at a moment of deep interest in her feelings for her child, he had lately given, lest she should take the alarm, and abate of that confiding frankness which was the choicest comfort of his life. It was possible that she might suddenly terminate their present friendly intercourse, or, at least, forbid the frequency of his visits. The next moment, he endeavoured to revive his former resolutions of abating this frequency, by a strenuous effort of prudence: but — it was too late — <FID>Why should he deny himself the only gratification for which he had now to hope?</FID> — <FID>he could not, he would not, do it: — the geographical lessons <i>must</i> be continued</FID> — yet he determined to absent himself for a few days. <FID>In the mean time, he <i>would</i> re-collect, re-compose himself, and resume his self-command: he <i>would</i> convince her that she had no more to apprehend from his confessions, and nothing to dread from, his solicitations.</FID>

With these resolves, interrupted but by short and uneasy slumbers, he arose in the morning; and calling up all his fortitude, endeavoured to induce Frederick to believe that he was well, and happy. — He applied closely to his engagements with his pupil, and devoted his leisure hours, with peculiar vigilance, to the cares of his profession, and the necessities, mental and bodily, of his parishioners.

<SceneDia>Three days had now elapsed, — and the morning on which <i>Helena</i> would expect him, at length arrived. He proposed to the delighted Frederick that they should adjourn to Mrs. Villiers’s.

<Dia>"And, do, Frederick, desire Thomas to follow us in a few minutes with the globe.”</Dia>

They arrived at the gate. Mr. Melcombe rang, with a beating heart. They entered — and, perceiving Mrs. Villiers, and Helena, at the further end of the garden,

<DiaM>"We will go — and — meet them,” — <M>said Mr. Melcombe, falteringly</M>.</DiaM> Mrs. Villiers felt embarrassed, as they approached. Frederick settled all this in a moment, by flying up to Mrs. Villiers, and exclaiming, as he threw his arms round her,

<DiaQ>"My dear, sweet, Mrs. Villiers, how do you do ? I have not seen you these three whole days! — how pretty you do look this morning!”</DiaQ>

<Dia>"My dear Frederick! how very foolish you are!”</Dia>

<Dia>"But you do, indeed! — now doesn’t she, Mr. Melcombe ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"Be quiet, Frederick;"</Dia> — <Descriptor>and Mrs. Villiers actually frowned.</Descriptor>

<DiaM>"Not prettier than <i>usual</i>” <M>said Mr. Melcombe — and he bent down to caress Helena, who had walked up, and put her little hand into his</M>.</DiaM>

Frederick took her other hand.

<Dia>"I did not know whether you intended to speak to <i>me, Mr. Frederick!</i>"</Dia>

<Dia>"Not speak to <i>you</i>! — yes, that I will, all day long.”</Dia>

They now all entered the dressing-room. The globe was brought in, and placed on the table. Helena passed her examination in her former lesson with great honour, and they proceeded to a new one. Mr. Melcombe turned the globe so as to place England at the top. He began to explain to Helena who, and what, were its antipodes. <DiaM>"Those who live here,” <M>said he, pointing underneath.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Won’t they fall down, Mamma ?”</Dia>

<DiaM>"Attend to Mr. Melcombe,” <M>said Mrs. Villiers.</M></DiaM> Mr. Melcombe then put Helena’s finger upon England, and was trying to hold the globe steady.

<DiaM>"Are you quite well, Mr. Melcombe ?” asked Helena.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Yes, my dear — why should you ask me just now ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"Because your hand shakes so sadly — only look, Mamma! — the globe won’t stand still.”</Dia>

Mr. Melcombe began to wish that both the children were dumb.

<DiaM>"My dear love,” said he, in a very impatient voice, "I beseech you to listen to me.”</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Be silent, and attentive, Helena,” <M>said Mrs. Villiers</M>.</DiaM> She was so; and, dropping a penitent courtesy, obtained forgiveness; and the lecture concluded without further difficulties.</SceneDia>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. V.</ChapMarker>

<SceneAction>Mrs. Villiers, one morning, gave Helena a commission which she very readily undertook: — it was to go, under the care of Betty, and visit a poor woman in the village, who had been very ill, and for whom Mrs. Villiers had been prescribing, but whom she had not seen for some days. Helena was directed to make particular inquiries whether she had received benefit from the medicines she had sent; and to carry such nourishing food as was proper in her exhausted state.

Just before they arrived at the cottage, they were met by Frederick, who, on hearing their errand, offered to join the party. They all entered the cottage. Helena performed her commission, and received from the invalid an improved account of her health, and a thousand blessings for herself, and her Mamma. Frederick gave the poor woman a token of his bounty, to assist her recovery; and Helena, seeing one of the children look very ragged, took out her little purse, and poured the whole of it's contents into his hand. Frederick then proposed to her to walk a little further with him. She consulted Betty, — who was of opinion that Mrs. Villiers could not possibly have any objection to it; and Helena tripped away, desiring Betty to follow her. Betty promised; — but, at that moment, was asked by Hannah Williams, the sick woman’s eldest daughter, some important question respecting Mrs. Villiers’s household — and <QuotesOther>"a good gossip”</QuotesOther> was what Betty could never resist. One anecdote produced another, and, while they were discussing the <QuotesOther>"home departments”</QuotesOther> of all the ladies within five miles round, Frederick and Helena were walking, and chattering, forgetting Betty, and losing their way. — They had turned into a lane that looked very green, and very pretty; and from thence entered a wood, into which they continued to advance for same time, concluding that they should be perfectly sure of returning as they went. Helena, however, at length bethought herself of Betty, and looked round; but Betty was no where to be seen.

<Dia>"We had better go back, Frederick: Mamma would not like me to go any further without Betty.”</Dia>

They did so; but made a wrong turn, and strayed further and further into the wood. — In a few minutes, they perceived something like a tent; and heard voices.

<DiaM>"Let us ask these people the way back,” <M>said Helena</M>.</DiaM>

<QuotesOther>"These people”</QuotesOther> had also heard them: — and now, two women,

<QuotedLit>"Withered, and wild in their attire,"</QuotedLit>

came out from their concealment, and approached them. They were, in truth, a family of gipsies, who, having, for sundry depredations on the sheep-fold and poultry-yards, been driven from one county to another, had lately fixed themselves in this wood, from which they sometimes emigrated, singly, or in small parties, to the village, in quest of provisions; — but they had not, yet, been actually detected in any enormities.

<DiaM>"How d’ye do, pretty Miss ?” <M>said the elder woman</M>; "give me a sixpence to cross your hand, and I’ll tell your fortune.”</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What’s telling my fortune ?” <M>asked Helena</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Telling you how you shall have a great deal of money, and a coach and six, and a great many husbands — and if you will give me the sixpence, I will tell you a great deal more.”</Dia>

<Dia>"But I have as much money as I want, and a poney that I like a great deal better than a coach, and I live with Mamma, and I don’t want any husband at all. — I wish you would show us the way back to —--”</Dia>

The woman, however, continued to detain Helena in talk, having particularly noticed her remark respecting money, and observed that she was dressed in the finest muslin, and had on a necklace fastened with gold.

She winked to the younger woman (who was her daughter), and still <ItalicsOther><i>gabbled</i></ItalicsOther> to Helena: then leading her, by degrees, a little on one side, pretended to show her the way out of the wood. The young woman in the mean time, played <i>her</i> part, and was earnestly addressing Frederick, and promising him a wife with blue eyes, and dark hair, and a dimple in her cheek, when he heard Helena’s voice shrieking out his name. He darted forward, and seeing the elder gipsy in the act of dragging her away towards a thicker part of the wood, he called out, as he ran,

<DiaQ>"Stop, you, Mrs. Conjuror, this minute, or I ’ll have you taken up, as sure as you are an ugly old witch.”</DiaQ> —

The woman ran the faster, and the girl tried to seize on Frederick; but he threw her violently from him, and soon coming up with the old woman, seized her by the collar of her cloak, and, had she not released her victim, in a few moments she would have been strangled. He snatched the hand of Helena from her grasp, and tucking it under his arm flourished a large stick which he had taken up, to keep the woman at a distance; and he was running off with the terrified Helena, when turning suddenly at the sound of a deep gruff voice from behind, they espied a man, with a complexion of a still darker tint than that of the females, advancing among the trees, with a dead sheep upon his back. On a sign from one of the women, he threw down the sheep, and hastened after the fugitives.

<DiaM>"Don’t you dare to come a step further, you Sir!” <M>cried Frederick</M>, “or you shall repent it.”</DiaM>

The man, however, still advanced, when Frederick taking up a large stone, promised faithfully to throw it at him if he approached. He hesitated — and at that moment, Frederick perceived a countryman, whom the frightened Betty, on missing Helena, had dispatched one way, while she ran, as fast as her legs could bear her, by another. The gipsy party now began to be a little apprehensive of the consequences of being surprised with the sheep they had stolen, and immediately gave up the pursuit.

Frederick, having no wish but to conduct Helena safe home, entreated the countryman to guide them out of the wood. — He readily complied, and Frederick, after rewarding him for his services, hastened to Mrs. Villiers’s with his beloved charge.</SceneAction> They fortunately arrived just before the bewildered Betty; who, having sought them in vain, was returning in despair to see whether the young stragglers had found their way home of themselves; and, if not, to terrify her mistress, as she would infallibly have done, with the communication that <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"Helena was lost — and — that there was a noted gang of gipsies in the neighbourhood.”</ReportedSpeechQuotes>

Helena, however, had now arrived, to tell her own story, in which Frederick’s prowess was not forgotten; and Mrs. Villiers, sufficiently alarmed at the danger which her darling had escaped, while she lavished on Frederick her praises, and acknowledgments, implored him, and charged Helena, never more to venture a single step beyond the village, unless with Mr. Melcombe or herself.

The next day, Mr. Melcombe set on foot an inquiry after the gipsy establishment — but the party had taken alarm at the threats of the young gentleman, and the sight of the countryman; and decamped in the night; — they forgot not to carry off their sheep in triumph, and now no trace of them was to be seen but the ashes of the fire on which they had dressed their stolen repasts.

<SceneDia>Helena’s rambles being now restricted to the garden, she was consoling herself with old Bernard's conversation, <Trigger>when</Trigger> Mr. Melcombe called, to relieve Mrs. Villiers from all future apprehensions from the gipsies, by communicating the news of their departure. Frederick was with him, and Helena, seeing them walk towards her with her mother, ran to meet them — crying, <DiaQ>"Now, dear Mamma, do, pray, let old Bernard tell you his comical story about his going to London!”</DiaQ>

<Dia>"Well, Bernard,” <M>said Mrs. Villiers</M>, “Helena tells me you have been in London, and that you saw very strange things there. I thought you had lived in this neighbourhood all your life, and had never been so far from home.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Why, you see, Madam, I was borned in Surry; and lived farmer's man, and sometimes worked in the gentlefolk's gardens for a many years, man and boy: — so you see, the young girls as goes up from this country, a harvesting, did used to work for my master — and so I took a bit of a liking to one on ’em, but she would not have me, she said, without I would come and live in her country, near her father and mother, like. So I left my master, d’ye see, and married her, and comed here, and then I took to gardening, and here I ha’ been ever since.”</Dia> —

<Dia>"But you went to London before you ever came here, I suppose, Bernard ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"Why, yes, Madam, I was o’telling o' little Miss how my master sent me once with some wuts to market, and another man wie’ me.”</Dia>

<Dia>"What are wuts, Mamma ?”</Dia>

<DiaM>"Surry for oats,” <M>said Mr. Melcombe</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaInset1P><Dia>"So you see, Madam, when it begun to be dusk — for we was ordered to be in Lunnun just before night, to be ready for the first o’ the market in the morning — I got into a clutter o’ carts, and such a mort of people that I got a looking at ’em to see what they was all a going about: — so presently I goes back to my cart, as I thoft, and I said summut to the man wie’ the horses, thinking how it was the same as I sot out with; but he spoke sulky like, and in a stre-ange voice — and surey<i>ly</i> there was I with a waggon and a man I never see’d before in all my life:  so off I sets, to look for my me-ate — so I comes where there was four or five roads, and what they called the Oblus in the middle: I thinks how it was at one Sir George’s fe-alds, or some sich a ple-ace. So I takes one road where I sees a cart, — but that wasn’t it — so, what to do I didn’t know; — but I goes on, and on — and comes to a bridge; — so then I thoft sure<i>ly</i> I was right, 'causen I knowed how I was to go over a bridge; so, when I got into the town, I was mortal tired — and I axed where I was, and they tould me I was in Wessmister: so then I thoft I had gone quite and clean to the wrong town: so, says I, ‘La! dear, why I oft to a’ gone to Lunnun.’ So then they fell a laughing, and said how I should never find out Lunnun if I goed away from Wessmister. So I thoft I would go on till I found some civiller like folks — so I went furder and furder, and some tould me one thing, and some another, and so it growed dark, — and I was got so tired and sleepy like, that I thoft as how I’d lay down and rest me a bit, till it was light again, and then I could find my way myself. So I sees a fine place with great postis over the door: so I lays me down, and falls fast asleep. By and bye, I hears such a clattering, and racketing o’ horses and carriages, the coachmen swearing, and driving along as thof they was all tosticated: — so up I jumps, and then to be sure I was frighted out o’ my sinses, for I thoft sure<i>ly</i> I must be killed in my sleep and got where all the bad people do bide: for first of all, to be sure I see’d the ould gentleman himself, and then, some wi’ horns, and some wi’ big noses, and some all over patch-work like.”</Dia>

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"Why old Bernard has certainly been to a masquerade;" <M>said Mr. Melcombe, laughing, aside to Mrs. Villiers.</M></DiaInsetInterruptionDia> —

<Dia>"And then, some as tall as the giant as shewed himself at our fair: and then again, some wi’ flames in their hands, all flying about in every body’s faces like; and then, such a hallering, and bawling, and one pushing me, and another swearing at me — so says I, ‘O! dear good Mr. D—1, let me go back again to the other world, and I won’t never be wicked no more.’ So then, some on ’em cries out, 'The fellow be mad;’ and then they all run one way, and t’other, and I got out easy enough, so I runned as long as I could, till I didn’t see no more crowd — so then I e’en ax’d my way hoame again; and when I got there I said how nobody should niver kitch me in Lunnun no more.”</Dia></DiaInset1P>

<DiaM>"Poor Bernard!” <M>said Mrs. Villiers, laughing,</M> — "so you were frightened out of your wits, while the people that you were so afraid of were making merry: — why they were only dressed up for amusement, Bernard. ”</DiaM>—

<Dia>"La! dear! begging your Ladyship’s pardon, if ever I see'd hobgoblins, and ould Nick at the head on ’em, I see’d ’em that there night — but I should say morning, for it was broad day-light; so I could not be dreaming, you do know.”</Dia>

Mrs. Villiers, finding this persuasion immoveable, gave up the attempt in despair, and Helena was happy, and full of triumph, at having, at last, gained her point, and prevailed on her mother to be entertained with old Bernard’s wonderful tale.

Frederick, whose time of returning to Eton drew near, entreated Mrs. Villiers that they might all have one ramble together before his departure.

<Dia>"You have not walked up the hills, Ma'am, I can’t tell when: <i>do</i>, let us all go to-morrow.”</Dia> Mr. Melcombe seconded the proposal, and it was carried <i>nem. con.</i></SceneDia>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. VI.</ChapMarker>

<SceneAction>The next day, when the morning studies were concluded, the little party assembled, took an early dinner, and began their projected walk. Frederick was pilot. He had observed, in his wanderings in the wood, a path leading up an height which having never yet attained, he was extremely anxious to explore. He and Helena went prattling on; and Mr. Melcombe and Mrs. Villiers engaged in a friendly and interesting conversation.

Helena began to lament to Frederick, his approaching departure.

<Dia>"I shall miss you so sadly when you go to school, Frederick.”</Dia>

<Dia>"So shall I you, Helena, and I don’t like going at all: but go I must, and let us not think about it.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Aye, but you won't want me half so much at Eton, as I shall want you here.”</Dia>

<Dia>"You at Eton! — a dove in a rookery — a fly in a bee-hive, a kitten in-—”</Dia>

<Dia>“There, there — you need not call me any more odd things.”</Dia> —

They pointed to the spot on which the tent of the gipsies had stood; — and Helena described eagerly to Mamma, precisely where, and how, <FIDquotes>"the yellow woman began to run away with her.”</FIDquotes>

They then pursued the path that led them up the mountain. The lakes began to lessen to their view; yet still the summit appeared to rise as they approached. Vast oaks, intermingled with the mountain-ash, were so far beneath their feet, that they obstructed not their view. — They now discovered a small spot that was sufficiently level to make them a seat, on which they might rest, and admire the stupendous prospect around them. — Hills, surmounting hills, winding rivers, and rocks of a mellow grey, nearly covered with shrubs, and tangled bushes of the richest green, presented to their delighted eyes, all the glorious varieties of nature.

<DiaM>"O how beautiful, Mamma!” <M>cried Helena</M>.</DiaM> <DiaM>"It is sublime!” <M>said Mr. Melcombe.</M></DiaM>

After a few minutes of silent contemplation he added,

<DiaQ>"The sun begins to redden, and grow broader. — I think we may safely watch its setting brightness, and yet reach home before it is dark.”</DiaQ>

No one was inclined to move, and they saw its last beams upon the golden lakes (for such they appeared), and the lengthened shadows of the towering hills, at last, gradually vanished from their eyes.

<DiaM>"'T is a pity,” <M>said Mrs. Villiers,</M> “but we must hasten homewards: I already fear the evening dews for Helena, who is very susceptible of cold.”</DiaM>

Helena sprang up in a moment, and approached nearer the edge of the precipice, to take a last look at the view; which Mrs, Villiers observing, rose in great alarm to catch her back; but the ground ran sloping towards the edge, and Mrs. Villiers in rising too hastily from her seat, trod on a loose stone which turned under her foot, and she fell some yards down the hill, which was so fearfully steep that she was in the utmost danger of being precipitated from the tremendous height, or bruised to death by the trees that might break her fall. Happily, however, one small tree, not far below, threw its head almost horizontally from the side of the mountain. The underwood caught her dress, and she hung for some moments — till Mr. Melcombe made a desperate dart down the steep, with his arms extended to catch at the tree — in which he succeeded — though not without bruising his arm by the rapidity of his descent. As soon as he had fixed himself on the tree, he seized Mrs. Villiers’ hand, exclaiming,

<DiaQ>"For God’s sake, dearest creature, hold me fast — I now can save you!”</DiaQ>

She grasped his hand, and put her arm over the tree, to which she clung, till, raising herself above it, she planted her foot above that of Mr. Melcombe, which he had set firmly in the ground; and then, by clasping the rocky earth with her hands, she regained in safety the brow of the precipice. Helena was screaming on its edge, and Frederick, while he restrained her struggling attempts to descend it, looking in agony on all that passed, with no possible means of rendering any assistance.

Mr. Melcombe, by the help of his stick, which he had carefully preserved, made a temporary resting-place for his foot, and soon recovered his former situation.

Hurt and terrified as they were, they had but a few minutes, in which to pause, and recover themselves, before they were compelled by increasing darkness, to hasten their return. Mutual inquiries, trepidations, and rejoicings, were half lost in the momentous concern of cautiously descending the mountain, and pushing through the wood, while there remained a glimpse of day-light — for moon there was none. Mrs. Villiers, however, found breath to utter a few words which spoke every thing to Mr. Melcombe of the gratitude of her warm and tender heart for a life thus saved, at the imminent hazard of his own.

<DiaM>"How can I ever thank you ?” <M>she concluded</M> — "it is quite, quite impossible!”</DiaM> —

<Dia>"Dearest, beloved Woman, talk not of gratitude: — God knows it was the extreme of selfishness — Oh! if you knew how you are twined about this heart of mine!"</Dia> —

Her hand was on his arm, and he pressed it closer to him.

<Dia>"Thank God! thank God! you are safe! — but tell me, I implore you, are you sure that you are not hurt ?”</Dia> —

<Dia>"A little, I believe; — but still more frightened. — My ancle is somewhat painful.”</Dia>

<DiaM>"Lean on me as much as possible” — <M>said Mr. Melcombe — trembling so violently that he could scarcely support her.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"But, my good friend,” <M>said she</M>, "I beseech you to take charge of Helena, in going down.”</DiaM>

<Dia>"Frederick shall go before with her, and you shall see that she is safe, but leave YOU <i>I cannot</i>."</Dia>

At length they reached the wood, as the shades of evening were closing around them. Mr. Melcombe carefully conducted them through it, and they saw not a human being, nor met with any further accident before they reached the village.</SceneAction>

As soon as they arrived, Mr. Melcombe, who perceived that Mrs. Villiers was totally overcome with fatigue, and terror, entreated her to take some refreshment, and retire immediately to rest. She very readily promised compliance: when Mr. Melcombe and his pupil, the former under great anxiety as to the probable consequences of their late mischance, returned to the rectory.

<SceneReadingWriting>When Frederick had retired to bed, Mr. Melcombe still trembling in body and mind, sat painfully retracing the dreadful alarm from which they had been delivered. His memory presented him, with torturing fidelity, the image of the woman he so tenderly loved, hanging over immediate and inevitable death: such, for an instant, an age in agony, it had appeared to him, and scarcely, even yet, could he catch a gleam of consolation from the idea that it was himself who had saved her life. Far too much agitated to hope for sleep, he would not leave his study. — He took up a pen — he recollected that, first in his terror, and afterwards in his transport at the safety of his beloved friend, he had used some expressions of tenderness which were stronger than he had intended ever to use again, or, than, as he had reason to fear, she would approve. This was his apology for his trespass: —

<QuotedText>"My dear Friend;

"May I venture to use that sacred name while I implore your forgiveness for some expressions which escaped me on this dreadful evening ? when for one moment, such a moment as I trust in Heaven I shall never endure again, I thought you were — gone for ever — Oh! how has this danger shewn me, unhappy as I now am, how much more unhappy I might be. You are living — you are near me — and I hope you are not materially the worse for what I thought would have been fatal. I entreat you to let me know as soon as possible in the morning, how you feel, and how you have rested. — Life of my life! may Heaven watch over your slumbers!

"But I began this to apologize for having too tenderly expressed my feelings, and, while I write, I offend again. After the few mournful, and, I fear, decisive words which you uttered on a former occasion, I made to myself a law to distress you no more with the tale of my unhappy emotions. You must, at the moment above alluded to, have read my heart; — but, you do not yet know that your image has been stamped on it ever since our earliest acquaintance; before you were married, or, I believe, engaged. — Situated as I then was, I dared not, <i>would</i> not speak. To have added to your comforts would have been the blessing of my life: to have solicited your hand while I could only invite you to poverty — no — I loved you too much for this! Late circumstances having betrayed me into expressions which have passed the bounds of friendship, this explanation became necessary — but, think not, most honoured and beloved of women, that I would seek to obtain even <i>your</i> favour by unwelcome solicitations, or win your compliance by pleading my constancy, or my sufferings. I have no merit in either. Let all merit rest with you, whose transcendent virtues have for ever fixed the affection which your person and manners originally engaged. If, indeed, your heart, — the only object of my soul's long ambition, be yet attainable — might I be allowed to hope that the 'time to mourn’ may ever pass away, and that it were for me to be the happy being who could engage that gentle mind which has so long fed on the memory of departed happiness. — Oh! might I but be suffered to feed on the possibility of attaining this high privilege, I would acknowledge the blessing with a fervour like that with which in all events I will pray for, and love you.

<MonologueThought>"Will she not suppose that I am making a merit of my services?” <M>said he within himself</M> — "yet, surely, she cannot so little understand me; — nay, but a few short hours ago, I disclaimed all title to her gratitude — I must explain to her the feelings which can alone be my excuse for those expressions that circumstances have wrung from my heart.”</MonologueThought> —

He thought — and thought again; and, in the morning, the letter was sent.</SceneReadingWriting> It was accompanied with anxious inquiries after the health of Mrs. Villiers and her daughter. The former had not yet risen; <FIDambig>for her ancle had been severely <ItalicsOther><i>bruised</i></ItalicsOther>, and she was, besides, extremely fatigued.</FIDambig> This account was sent in answer to Mr. Melcombe’s enquiries; and the letter was for some hours unacknowledged.

It occasioned Mrs. Villiers the sincerest regret. Highly respecting, and deeply regarding Mr. Melcombe, she, however, felt it impossible to admit a second love to her heart, — and was utterly incapable of plighting her faith, without her love. She meditated long, and at last wrote thus: —

<QuotedText>"Will it not look like ingratitude to say that your letter gives me real pain ? — Yet how undeserving should I be of a suspicion like this! At such a moment, when to you I owe that I still exist, I must be a wretch indeed could. I feel any thing short of the most ardent gratitude — and ere I can pay the worthless tribute of my thanks for the life you saved, your claims rise higher still, in virtue of an affection so long cherished, by me unknown, and even unthought of, and which struck its deep root beneath an adverse sky, escaped the scythe of Time, and has even outlived the blight of disappointment. —

"Yet, though I am the unfortunate cause of embittering the life of one so capable of imparting, and so worthy to receive, all happiness, I am still the innocent cause. Never did I seek to win a regard which I could not return; and I have told you, as I am sure you were convinced before, that I did not even suspect your preference of me at the early period to which you allude. And now — you ask me for my heart: — it is in the grave; — or rather let me say, it is in Heaven — with him to whom, on earth, I gave it.

Claim any thing, my most respected friend, claim every thing but the gift of a heart which is not mine — or a hand to which that heart could never be subjoined.

"Let us not meet, for a few days to come — and then, let me entreat it — as friends, and only friends. By that name, and is it not a choice one ?

<i>To Mrs. Villiers.</i>

<QuotedText>Gentlest, and most amiable of human beings, I owe you eternal gratitude for your kind, your merciful letter. It tells me nothing but what I dreaded, what I expected. — Yet, weak as I am! I feel as if it brought a fresh disappointment. That it is decisive I know! — Its conclusion shall be obeyed — as shall every, the smallest wish of your heart, which you will yet indulge me by suffering me to execute.

"I am afflicted — I confess it — and I shall afflict you if I write more.

"Dearest, <i>only</i> Friend of my soul,

"Farewell.
