<ChapMarker>CHAP. I.</ChapMarker>

AT a time, when enthusiasm, religious and military, was at its height, and, with united powers, promoted the spirit of <i>Crusade</i>; <ChPortrait>HUGH DE MONTMORIN, alike insensible to the allurements of martial glory, and the thunders of the Vatican, remained tranquil within the limits of this paternal territory; thus sacrificing to the duties of domestic life that ardent passion for military achievement, to which his youthful breast was by no means a stranger.</ChPortrait>

His mother, LAURA DE MONTMORIN (by the untimely death of her husband, who had fallen in single combat with a neighbouring Baron) was left surrounded by a numerous family, and exposed to an encreasing host of formidable distresses. Her castle lay near to that of the Baron, who had deprived her of her Lord; nor did the resentments of VALLANCE, sleep in the grave of MONTMORIN.

In those days of semi-barbarism, the sword of <i>chivalry</i> (which the inimitable DON QUIXOTE has forever sheathed) was found a necessary auxiliary to the sword of <i>justice</i>; and the monarch himself, (because unaided by the genius of romance) frequently found that the insolence of usurping vassals made his throne to totter.

LAURA'S mind was well aware of all the dangers inseparable from her situation, and to <i>her</i> intreaties was it owing that the young Baron made a determination <i>not</i> to leave her defenceless and unprotected in so perilous a neighbourhood. His retirement therefore although <i>inactive</i>, was by no means <i>inglorious</i>.

In those unpolished times, a state of rural elegant society, such as <i>we</i> enjoy, was <i>absolutely</i> unknown; and neighbouring Nobles had little intercourse, but <i>merely</i> such as mutual safety required, or as a desire to restrain regal power occasioned.

Thus circumstanced, HUGH DE MONTMORIN could not seek the sweets of social intercourse, beyond the limits of his paternal castle, within which narrow circle was a young woman, trained up under the kindest protection of his family, daughter of a gentleman who (having borne arms under the father of the youthful Baron) fell in the Plains of PALESTINE; leaving his only child to his patron's care. Of this important trust the noble guardian acquitted himself most generously, educating his lovely ward as his own daughters were educated, and, (by his will) allotting her a portion equal to that he bequeathed to each of his own younger children.

HELOISE was now in her seventeenth year, her figure elegant, her features <i>not</i> correctly framed according to the statuary's established rules, but her bewitching countenance was marked with an expression, <i>interesting in the extreme</i>. Two persons of different sexes, and of nearly the same age, and who, <i>necessarily</i> pass much of their time together, seldom continue <i>long</i> in a state of indifference with respect to each other: it is with <i>people</i> as with <i>plants</i>, most of them have secret qualities, good and bad, which are discovered, only, by intimate acquaintance.

The friendship between HUGH DE MONTMORIN, and his fair inmate, had naturally ripened into <Sententia>that pure love, which lies concealed at the bottom of the heart; and, for a time, is not known even to ourselves.</Sententia> A <i>mutual</i> attachment could not, however, remain for any length of time, a secret to either party; <Sententia>there being no disguise which can long conceal love where it is, or feign it where it is not</Sententia>: in those days the forms of courtship were, in general, tedious and disgustingly ceremonious; but the situation of this happy pair superseded every thing of this nature and an unequivocal avowal of mutual love, soon took place. MONTMORIN, however, (apprehensive. that a connection so little splendid might not meet the ideas of if his family) determined on keeping his attachment secret for the present: meanwhile he continued to enjoy the delightful opportunities, afforded by his circumstances, of breathing his vows at the feet of HELOISE, who (superior to artifice) attempted not to conceal the pleasure the received from his addresses.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. II.</ChapMarker>

MONTMORIN had hitherto experienced <i>only <QuotedLit>the sweets of Love</QuotedLit></i>, <Sententia>a passion, which, the moment it ceases to hope or to fear, ceases to exist: Were we to judge of love by <i>most</i> of its effects, we should think it resembled hatred more than kindness</Sententia>. To the passion of jealousy the breast of MONTMORIN had been hitherto a stranger; for <Sententia>although its birth is <i>always</i> coeval with that of love, yet it never discovers itself, until called forth by some danger, real or imaginary.</Sententia>

Whilst MONTMORIN and his HELOISE were enjoying the pleasures arising from a virtuous and unreserved attachment, he received a message from his Sovereign, notifying his intention to visit the castle of MONTMORIN, in his tour through the Province.

The various preparations necessary on so important, and (in those days) uncommon an event, having entirely engrossed the attention of the Baron, the idea of a royal <i>rival</i> had never presented itself to his imagination. On the appointed day the monarch and his train arrived. The mother and sisters of MONTMORIN, with the too lovely HELOISE, were presented to the Sovereign, who received them, <i>not only</i> graciously, but with all the obliging attentions to which they had so just a claim.

No sooner had the King observed the blushing HELOISE, than his whole soul was absorbed in the idea of being possessed of her incomparable charms. Having (as hastily as he could with propriety) partaken of the sumptuous banquet prepared for him, the love-sick Prince retired to his apartment, where, as soon as he found himself with no other attendance than his confidential servant, FRONTIN, <i>to him</i> the important secret was communicated. To this faithful domestic he gave it in charge, that he should endeavour to learn every particular relating the fair object of his wishes. FRONTIN burned with impatience to merit his master's thanks, and flew from the royal presence in quest of intelligence. 

MONTMORIN <i>also</i> retired to his apartment, but with such apprehensions of the monarch's susceptibility, as soon brought him out again, that he might disclose his grief to HELOISE. <FIDambig><i>Her affection for him was not founded on the tottering basis of wealth and ambition</i></FIDambig>, and therefore he had as little reason to fear from the rivalry of a Prince as from that of a peasant, <FIDambig><i>so far as her constancy was concerned</i></FIDambig>. And, if her <i>vanity</i> was a <i>little</i> flattered, (by the consequence which so dazzling a conquest might give her) yet her <i>heart</i> was sincerely <i>alarmed</i>, when she considered the <i>power of</i> her new admirer: to MONTMORIN, therefore, the proposed the scheme of <i>affected indisposition</i>. The plan was eagerly embraced by a lover, on the rack of jealousy, as what could <i>alone</i> retrieve his own imprudent conduct, in having suffered his Sovereign to contemplate the beauties of his mistress.

Matters being thus concerted, he returned to his chamber, where, throwing himself on his couch, he in vain endeavoured to procure repose: sleep was, for the greatest part of the night, banished from his eyes, by the undescribable agitation of his mind; at length, however, <i>exhausted nature</i> sunk into <i>apparent</i> forgetfulness.

But the distracting idea of being robbed of all that his soul held most dear, could not be driven from his imagination; his <i>dreams</i>, therefore, though varied in <i>circumstantials</i>, yet were most painfully <i>uniform</i> as to their <i>subject</i>. At one time they represented the King, as hurrying HELOISE from his arms by force; at another, she seemed to make <i>faint</i> resistance, or rather <i>not to resist at all</i>; at length, the appearance of AURORA relieved the wretched sufferer from distresses merely ideal.

When the Lord of the castle rose from his couch, he comforted himself with reflecting that the <i>most</i> afflicting part of his <i>dreaming distresses</i> could not be realized, because he could not suspect the constancy of HELOISE; but then he knew that she might forcibly be torn from him by the rude hand of power: it was now, however, time to cut short all reflections, and to prepare for the necessary attendance on the King, whose repose had been nearly as much disturbed as that of his host.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. III.</ChapMarker>

MONTMORIN having received a summons to attend in the apartment of his royal visitor, hastened to the levee --- from whence he waited on him to the great hall, where breakfast was prepared. Here the King's disappointment but too plainly betrayed itself in his looks, when on casting his eyes eagerly around, he discovered the absence of HELOISE.

To Lady MONTMORIN he expressed himself much grieved at the vacancy in the beautiful circle;. and being informed that her absence was caused by illness, he expressed an anxiety which put the Baron's soul <i>on the rack</i> 

Breakfast being ended, the King and his suite, accompanied by MONTMORIN, proceeded to take the diversion of hunting; and on their return to the castle, many and anxious were the royal enquiries after the health of HELOISE: which the monarch had the sore mortification to learn was considerably worse.

When the hour of rest arrived, and the King found himself again alone with FRONTIN, he satisfied his impatient longings after intelligence concerning the fair engrosser of his affections; and happy was he to find that her situation was rather a dependant one, which circumstance served to cherish his hopes of success ; --- and after revolving in his mind the most probable means of accomplishing his project, he at length determined, that <i>(at the moment of their departure)</i> FRONTIN should feign himself violently ill, and, on this pretence, remain for some days an inhabitant of the castle.

The monarch flattered himself that FRONTIN'S prolonged stay might afford a favourable opportunity of conveying to HELOISE information of the brilliant conquest she had made. This scheme being finally agreed on, the confident was dismissed; -- on the next morning, (after acknowledging the hospitalities of the castle) the King prepared to depart, when, just as he was crossing the draw-bridge, the preconcerted indisposition of FRONTIN took place; his fits were violent, and his royal master, (with a well-feigned regret) left him to the care of Lady MONTMORIN.

The departure of a kingly visitor is the removal of a great incumbrance, even from the family of a subject of the first rank; but <i>that</i> riddance was, comparatively, trifling to MONTMORIN, who parted, at once, with a rival and a royal guest.

With respect to the illness of FRONTIN, the Baron had, however, his doubts, which determined him to preclude the supposed invalid from all intercourse in the castle, except with his own confidential valet. In a remote, but spacious apartment, therefore, he entertained the <i>suspected spy</i>, who. was attended by a servant entirely devoted to the Baron's interest.

After a melancholy and ineffectual <i>sejour</i> of three days, FRONTIN could discover that <i>he himself</i> was watched; and that <i>therefore</i> he could not render any service to his employer; accordingly, he rapidly recovered his former health, and bid adieu to the scene of his voluntary confinement; leaving the castle, possessed of no one piece of intelligence, which he had not acquired before the King's departure, excepting only that the Baron and HELOISE were <i>supposed</i> to cherish a reciprocal attachment for each other.

FRONTIN'S leaving his station restored in a good measure, to the breast of MONTMORIN, its accustomed tranquillity; and some weeks elapsed undistinguished by any remarkable event.

This <i>calm</i>, was, however, ruffled most unexpectedly, by the arrival of a courier with a letter from the King, couched in terms the most flattering, and appointing MONTMORIN to the command of the troops which he was on the point of sending to the relief of RHODES.

The Baron was at no loss to account for this honorable <i>(but most unseasonable)</i> exile; so chagrined was he by this insidious offer, that, at the first, he hesitated whether or not he should accept it. Violent was the struggle between love and honour; on the one hand, the risque of losing HELOISE; on the other, the idea of shewing himself unworthy of her, by a dastardly refusal of an honorable command,

In this perplexity, to HELOISE he applied for counsel. --- She (with a heroism not so marvellous in <i>her</i> days, as it would be in ours) determined his choice by saying, <SpeechInsert>"if you go, the torch of love will light you in the path of glory; and I will, in your absence, retire to the protection of my aunt (Abbess of the Paraclete). <i>There</i> I will await, with an anxiety which words can but poorly express, the return of my beloved, from the field. Rest assured (added she) that my love for your honour, it is, which <i>alone</i> could support me in the prospect of this temporary separation; and that my attachment to you is much too deeply rooted to be shaken by the hand of power, or the rude blast of adversity." <DescriptorQ>She closed her counsel with remarking, that</DescriptorQ> "<i>absence lessens a moderate passion, but feeds a great one</i>, like the wind which extinguishes a taper, but kindles a conflagration."</SpeechInsert>

This speech had its due weight with the <i>wavering</i> Baron, who notified to the King his ready acceptance of the appointment with which he was honoured, and declared, that he waited but for <i>orders to embark.</i> 

To the advice of the heroical HELOISE her lover listened the more readily, because the Baron de VALLANCE was at that time imprisoned, on account of some ouvert acts of sedition. The effects of which would, probably, for a long season, incapacitate him from offering any violence to the House of MONTMORIN.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. IV.</ChapMarker>

NOT many days were suffered to elapse before the generous HELOISE, having procured a proper disguise, set off at midnight <i>for the Paraclete</i>.

MONTMORIN was her only companion, and after a journey of somewhat more than two days, they arrived safely at the wished for habitation of her aunt.

At the castle, her departure occasioned the utmost confusion. Lady MONTMORIN immediately suspecting the Baron of having secreted HELOISE; at the same time she was unable to account for such a step, as the <i>King's</i> partiality to her, was a secret into which no one there had ever dived.

The Baron having settled his fair fugitive under the care of the Abbess, hastened to embark for RHODES. Thither we shall leave him to pursue his voyage, and turn our attention to the King, who delayed not an hour to avail himself of the opportunity, afforded (as he supposed by his rival's absence) <FIDitalics><i>to push his favourite plan on to perfection</i></FIDitalics>.

To the castle of MONTMORIN he repaired without loss of time, under pretext of intimidating, by his presence, the turbulent vassals of the seditious VALLANCE; who, on the imprisonment of their Lord had given some proofs of a tendency to. insurrection.

Instantly after the King's arrival at the castle, the royal visitor repeated his enquiries after HELOISE. The news of her flight enraged him to the utmost, and caused a most passionate avowal of his attachment. The enraged Monarch resolved to ransack every corner of his dominion till he should discover the place of her retreat. To the Lady MONTMORIN he gave it in charge to transmit to him minutely and expeditiously, every intelligence she should be able to procure concerning the late elopement.

From PARIS, whither he then returned, he sent the strictest orders to every sea-port in his kingdom, to prevent, (if possible) the escape of HELOISE.

Meanwhile, she wrote a letter to Lady MONTMORIN, replete with affection and gratitude, and expressing the most ardent good wishes for the prosperity of the noble family, under whose patronage the helpless orphan had been blessed with the tenderest attentions. She urged, that <FIDitalics><i>indispensable</i></FIDitalics> necessity had <FIDitalics><i>caused</i></FIDitalics>, and would, one day, <FIDitalics><i>fully vindicate</i></FIDitalics>, the withdrawing herself from MONTMORIN; that she was <FIDitalics><i>then</i></FIDitalics> safe in the retirement of a convent, where she proposed to remain until a change of circumstances should render it prudent for her to appear, once more, in the little circle of her honoured friends. The Confessor of the Paraclete conveyed this packet by a peasant, who was prohibited to enter the precincts of the castle, being ordered to repair thither in the evening, and to throw the letter over the moat.

Having executed his commission, the messenger returned to his employer; the packet that he carried, fully accounted to Lady MONTMORIN for the King's outrageous behaviour on hearing of the departure of HELOISE. With his Majesty's passion it seemed probable, that she herself had long been acquainted, and as his designs must be considered as <i>not honourable</i>; <i>therefore</i> to the virtuous education bestowed on the fair fugitive (independent of any pre-engagement of affections) the Baroness ascribed the present conduct of HELOISE.

The mysterious manner in which this intelligence was conveyed, led Lady MONTMORIN to suppose, that her young friend was secreted somewhere in the neighbourhood of the castle; and served totally to preclude all ideas of her having taken refuge in so distant an asylum as the Paraclete.

The Baroness (though in a degree disinclined to her son's intermarriage with a person not distinguished by nobility of birth) yet felt the utmost abhorrence, at the idea of her amiable ward's being forced into the toils of royal seduction.

To the King, therefore, she did not communicate the letter, or any part of its intelligence. He had not, however, quitted her castle, without first securing in his interest a domestic of the family, from whom he received an account of the purport of that packet.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. V.</ChapMarker>

THE Monarch, whose patience had been nearly exhausted by a series of fruitless researches (made at every port in FRANCE) began now to flatter himself with some hopes of success. He prudently resolved to scrutinize narrowly the recesses of all the convents in his territories, especially of those that were adjacent to MONTMORIN.

Regard to decorum, however, induced him to conceal under a <i>specious pretence</i>, the true cause of this general and accurate enquiry. To this end, the Baron D'ANOIS, (one of the Nobles who had attended the King on his first visit to MONTMORIN, and who <i>there</i> consequently had become acquainted with the person of HELOISE) was directed to secrete his only daughter, a rich heiress, then in her thirteenth year.

A solemn and formal application was next made, for the royal permission to examine every convent throughout the dominions of FRANCE, under pretence, that her great and independent wealth had rendered the fair subject of this search a prey to some avaricious procuress in the cause of cloystered devotion; and that she would probably be kept immured in the darksome abode of sequestered piety, until her assumption of the veil should have effectually insured to the convent the possession of her estate.

The plan was plausible, and, as such, it was put into practice: <i>fictitious intelligence</i> comes whensoever it is wanted; accordingly news soon arrived, that served as a pretext to commence the search, and it began not far from the castle whence HELOISE had escaped.

The conductor of the scrutiny carried on his investigation through the whole vicinage of MONTMORIN --- in vain had he searched all the neighbouring religious foundations, when the Paraclete was, by one of his confidential attendants, pointed out as the <i>probable</i> residence of <i>her</i> for whom <i>he really sought</i>.

The uncommon veneration in which this convent was held, rendered some (more than ordinary) formalities <i>expedient</i>, if not <i>necessary</i>, in any attempt to violate the secrecy of its precincts. Accordingly, the Baron (having explained to the Abbess the <i>ostensible</i> cause of his visit, and presented to her the King's letter, addressed to, and countersigned by the Bishop of the diocese, solicited her permission to see every inhabitant of the convent.

At the grate there appeared, therefore, <i>unveiled, all</i> the members of the house ; that <i>no one</i> was secreted, the Lady Abbess solemnly confirmed by the requisite oath. The unconscious HELOISE presented her fair face, <i>without reluctance</i>, because, <i>without suspicion.</i>

No sooner had the Baron descried her, than he delivered to her a letter from his master, overflowing with professions of inviolable and ardent attachment: supplicating her to accept his heart, and to complete his felicity, by accompanying his faithful D'ANOIs to PARIS, where it should be the unceasing business of his life to make her the <FIDitalics><i>happiest</i></FIDitalics>, as she was <FIDitalics><i>the most lovely</i></FIDitalics>, of her sex.

HELOISE (after a cursory reading of the letter) cooly and firmly replied, that her birth rendered her by no means a proper partner for a throne; but she flattered herself both it and her <i>education</i> might have screened her from <i>insult</i>; that in her opinion, "<SententiaCharacter><i>innocence was a treasure infinitely too valuable to be bartered away, in exchange for the counterfeit gaiety, and artificial happiness of splendid ignominy.</i></SententiaCharacter>"

The groveling mind of D'ANOIS was little prepared for the reception of so <i>dignified</i> an answer to his <i>dazzling</i> though <i>debasing</i> proposal: but the soul of one who embarks <i>in such a business</i>, is already sufficiently sunk, to use <i>any</i> expedient whatever that may promise success. Accordingly, partly from fear of incurring the royal displeasure, in case of failure, and partly, from the certain expectation of losing that reward of his services which his imagination had painted in glowing colours --- the Baron determined, that <i>force</i> should assist his own <i>too feeble eloquence</i>.

Against this premeditated outrage the vigilance and magnanimity of the Lady Abbess provided effectually. --- She <i>spiritly observed</i> that HELOISE had on <i>her</i>, a double claim for protection; and therefore, that <i>without her own consent</i>, she should never leave those walls, raised for the sacred purpose of affording an asylum to <i>persecuted or to deserted innocence</i>.

D'ANOIS entertained too delicate a sense of the danger to which (<i>in those days</i>) all persons exposed themselves, who provoked the complaints of cloystered societies; to push matters on to extremity, he therefore was constrained to return, and relate to his anxious employer the failure of his plan.

The mind of HELOISE was, meanwhile, torn with inexpressible disquietudes. She dreaded, lest her enraged and disappointed suitor, armed, as he was with regal power, might be tempted to <i>break down, or to overleap</i> all the barriers with which religious reverence, and public opinion, had defended the retreats of a con-vent: or <i>at the least</i>, she dreaded the dismal consequences which might ensue to her generous protectress, in case of her perseverance in the noble line of conduct she had hitherto pursued. Flight from the Paraclete, and a participation of her lover's lot (whatever that might be) presented themselves to her distracted mind, as preferable, on the whole, to any other plan. In calamitous circumstances, it is surely wisdom to catch comfort, where one can, and what <i>sublunary</i> comfort more desireable to her, than the society of a protector, such as MONTMORIN ? She therefore resolved <i>not</i> to listen to any suggestion <i>of fear</i>, but to repair directly to the isle of RHODES.

This determination will probably be, by some persons, condemned as <i>rash in the extreme</i>, whilst others (and those the best judges) will ascribe the conduct of our heroine to <Sententia>that <i>true magnanimity</i> which stoops to no power, and is shaken by no adversity; which, by its own peculiar lustre, adorns and heightens every other virtue, and renders its dignified subject little solicitous about the decision of judges who consider men's actions as <i>blank rhimes</i>, to which every one may apply what sense he pleases.</Sententia>

Actuated neither by <i>whim</i> nor <i>caprice</i>, nor even entirely by her <i>own attachment</i>, but under the guidance of genuine greatness of soul, she resolved to leave a country, though her native one, which too probably could not <i>long</i> afford to her <i>honour</i> a safe asylum: wisdom and love conspired to raise, and to sustain her mind on this arduous occasion, and <RhetoricalQ>to <i>what</i> exertions is not humanity equal, when <i>thus</i> directed, and <i>thus</i> supported?</RhetoricalQ>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. VI.</ChapMarker>

HELOISE, her plan once formed, delayed <i>not</i> for a moment the execution of it. The porter of the convent was soon bribed into her interest, and she took leave of her cloyster, immediately after mattins next morning. For companion of her flight, she had a guide, whom the door-keeper procured for her; and they directed their steps by the light of a bright moon to a neighbouring village. There the amiable and accomplished fugitive assumed the appearance of a minstrel, for which disguise her musical talents well fitted her. Equiped in her new character, she pursued her journey to the next sea-port, and in a few days found herself, for the first time, within sight of the ocean.

The feelings and the apprehensions of a young and delicate female, thus circumstanced, will hardly admit of an adequate description.

Umpire of her own fate, and sovereign of her own actions, without the aid of any counsellor : --- Of that prudence, which is the result of experience, she could not possess a large stock; but duty to herself, and passion for her lover, conspired to <i>point out her path</i>. The novelty of the scene before her excited admiration; whilst the idea, that the widely extended abyss, rolled its countless waves between her and the object of her fondest regard, tempted her to despair.

The die was, now cast; the <i>first</i> opportunity was therefore to be embraced, of committing herself to the faithless element. A transport laden with military stores for RHODES lay at the quay, ready to slip her cables; the guide was rewarded, and dismissed; her passage was agreed for, and (in a few hours after her arrival at the sea-side) the magnanimous minstrel was launched upon the deep.

For the first day and night the wind and weather were propitious; on the second morning they both altered unfavourably, and continued adversely tempestuous for a week; the sufferings of the lovely wanderer during this dreary season of mental agitation, and of extreme inconvenience, were such as would irremediably have sunk a spirit less elevated and firm. Nothing contributed more to the distress of her mind, on this occasion, than an apprehension that the winds and waves <i>might be found to fight against her</i>, by driving the vessel back into a FRENCH harbour.

<SceneQuasi>These fears of HELOISE, were, on the ninth day of the voyage, sadly realized; for, whilst seated pensive on the deck, and occupied, in ruminating on this sad reverse of fortune (being now arrived at the Pier) she was awakened from her reverie by the chilling appearance of D'ANOIs: he, on a second visit to the Paraclete had, by promises of indemnity, and an immense bribe, learned from the porter every particular relative to the <i>departure, disguise</i>, and probable <i>destination</i> of the lovely wanderer. Her guide was sent for to the Baron's quarters, near the convent, where the <i>principles of loyalty</i> were found absolutely necessary to be called forth, and their influence <i>added</i> to a considerable reward, before D'ANOIS could extract from him the certain knowledge of every minute circumstance of the embarkation. This poor peasant had a mind superior to his condition, and could at last be induced to reveal his employer's secret, <i>only</i> by an assurance, (to which he gave credit) that a treason of the blackest dye, against the life of the Monarch, was the charge on which the fugitive was to be arrested.

D'ANOIS, no longer in doubt as to the measures to be taken, pursued the steps of HELOISE, determining to carry on the chace, on the sea as well as on the land, in the most expeditious manner possible. The contrary and boisterous winds had detained him on the rack, till the morning of the transport's putting back; great was his joy when he beheld his plan advancing so successfully, on being told by the matter of the vessel, that a minstrel, in every respect answering his description, was at that moment upon deck.

Thither he flew to secure his prey: the sight of him quite overpowered the hitherto unshaken mind of HELOISE, who (whilst yet in a fainting fit) was hurried on shore by her vigilant and indefatigable pursuer.

D'ANOIS was the first object that presented itself to her half opening eyes ; --- he now assumed all the appearances of soothing and sympathizing regard: He set before her, what <FIDitalics><i>he</i> called the <i>happiness</i> of her escaping from the completion of a plan, so <i>rash</i>, and so <i>degrading</i>, and which would, probably, have proved <i>disgusting</i> also to him she sought. He then proceeded to ridicule, her ideas of right and wrong, which she justly considered as in their nature <i>immutable</i>; and assured her, with many <i>eloquent shrugs</i>, that ladies were honored, <i>not</i> disgraced, by granting favours to <i>Kings</i>. He urged, that the highest rank, with suitable opulence, now awaited her; whilst, in case of obstinate refusal of the proffered happiness, and enviable distinctions, she could not expect the enjoyment of her <i>liberty</i>; for, that her Monarch might be hurt by the <i>avowed preference</i> given by his subjet to his <i>rival</i>.</FIDitalics>

To these arguments HELOISE listened with silent disdain --- her <FIDitalics><i>soul</i> was calm and serene; she said, that in forming her plan, she had suffered much, from perturbations, <i>how</i> best to escape from <i>titled infamy</i>; but that, to <i>those troubles</i>, an happy calm had succeeded, which enabled her to judge of her present perilous situation; and that for a mind well principled, a prison, <i>unattended by guilt</i>, had no such horrors as those, with which she unaffectedly thought of the residence of a <i>King's mistress</i>.</FIDitalics>

HELOISE then resolutely <FIDitalics><i>demanded her freedom</i></FIDitalics> --- to this D'ANOIS replied, that she who could command a great Monarch had little reason to regret being restrained from destroying her own happiness; adding, that if ever her royal lover should betray any inconstancy; or if, at any very remote period of life, she herself should wish to retire from the world, she might return to her beloved Paraclete in the <FIDitalics><i>exalted rank of Lady Abbess</i></FIDitalics>.

HELOISE, incensed to the utmost, at his last outrageous insult, replied with indignation, <DiaQ>"Think not, that after I should have once forsaken the paths of Virtue, I could expect support, (under my <i>weight of woe</i>) from any, <i>elevation</i> that is only advantageous to those who have <i>not</i> bartered away principle in exchange for any <i>other</i> good; and you may be assured, that your base business is <i>not</i> the nearer to a successful issue, because you have obtained the custody of my person: -- my <i>mind</i> is still <i>free</i>, and will continue so; and my affections <i>will</i> never, <i>can</i> never, submit to the <i>power</i> of that despicable despot who disgraces by thus employing you. Desist therefore from attempting to execute what your heart must condemn; blush at what you have done, for where <i>there is shame</i>, there <i>may</i> be <i>virtue</i>.</DiaQ>

The disheartened D'ANOIS, full of perplexity, and half ashamed of his embassy, retired from HELOISE, having first carefully secured her door.</SceneQuasi> After the absence of a few hours this unsuccessful pleader returned to his charge, and informed her that, on the following morning, he should conduct her to PARIS. He then pressed her to accept of some refreshments, of which she partook sparingly and silently. This done, he took his leave, with expressions of much politeness, and with sentiments of more real respect than he had ever before entertained <i>for any female whatever</i>.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. VII.</ChapMarker>

HELOISE had not spent her solitary time that day, <i>merely as an hopeless prisoner in the Bastille</i>, in revolving the adventures of her life, and in thinking what might hereafter be the sequel of her tragic story; but she devoted part of her attention to a strict examination of the situation and strength of her prison. She soon perceived that the upright iron bars of the windows in the bedchamber were inserted in frames less strong than those of the outer room; and that with the help of a knife, one of them might easily be removed from its decayed socket.

These useful observations were made before she had partaken of her sparing repast, and no sooner had her despicable jailor wished her a night of undisturbed repose, than she proceeded to avail herself of the discovery she had made respecting the windows.

As soon as she had effected the removal of the window-bar, she was able, by looking commodiously out of the casement, to explore the situation of her place of confinement. She had now the satisfaction to find, that as her prison-house was built on the very rampart, if she could, by any means, descend from her window, and reach the ground <i>unhurt</i>, she might possibly effect an escape: this plan she accordingly accomplished by means of D'ANOIS sash, which he had left in the room.

HELOISE having accustomed herself to smaller dangers, had increased her intrepidity, and fitted her mind for meeting greater ones: ignorant of the country where she now found herself --- at a loss whither to fly --- guided by the roaring of the billows, she directed her, steps to the beach. There the amiable wanderer encountered a person, who, in the event proved, the master of a vessel then in the offing, which waited but <i>his</i> presence to slip her cable. To his enquiries, respecting her destination, and the cause of her present nocturnal ramble, HELOISE made answer, that <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"having arrived too late to procure admission into the town, she had been constrained to await, unhoused, the approach of day, when she hoped to procure a passage for RHODES, whither she was bound."</ReportedSpeechQuotes>

The great estimation in which the minstrels of those times were held by all ranks, the idea that their character were, in some sort, sacred, the elegant entertainment their company never failed to afford, in an age not abounding with elegance of any sort, induced the master to make offer of a place in his vessel to the fictitious bard, who joyfully embracing so desirable an opportunity of eluding the researches of her pursuers, once more committed herself to the <i>faithless element</i>. A few hours wafted her from the shores of FRANCE, and a favourable gale served gradually to <i>dissipate her apprehensions</i>; whilst D'ANOIS (on discovering the flight of HELOISE) became quite desperate; and, dreading the resentment of his disappointed employer, he rashly terminated, by his own hand, a life devoted to the equally cruel and ignorant pursuits of seduction ; a conduct for which he could not even urge the flimsy extenuation of an ungoverned passion of <i>his own</i>. The King, meanwhile, consoled himself for the loss of HELOISE, by the society of D'ANOIS' <i>orphan daughter</i>, whose unprotected condition rendered her an easy victim to the royal designs. 

<Sententia>It nearly concerns all who lay snares for female innocence, to consider, that the time <i>may</i> come, when (at the expence of their own nearest and dearest, connections) the law of retaliation may be put in execution against themselves; and however the vanity that <i>inspires</i>, may <i>varnish</i> over the cruel act of seduction, yet, in the unavoidable moments of reflection it will appear in its true colours, and as the certain fore-runner of events equally fatal to individuals, and to society at large.</Sententia>

<Sententia>No one would be <i>more</i> unhappy than a person who had <i>never</i> known adversity, which, whoever bears <i>properly</i>, (in some sort) may be said to <i>deserve</i> prosperity.</Sententia>

HELOISE was supported, by considering, that each wave wafted her nearer to her gallant lover; while he was employed in reaping laurels on the shore of RHODES, at the memorable siege of a city, reckoned one of the seven, wonders of the worlds and which had, two hundred years before that time, been rescued out of the possession of the SARACENS, by the Knights of JERUSALEM.

MONTMORIN shared largely in the applause bestowed on the glorious exertions of public spirit, and the nearly unequalled proofs of personal prowess, which conspired to give deathless fame to the defenders of RHODES.

No sooner was the projected siege of this city publickly, known, than EUROPE beheld the flower of her nobility, crowding with enthusiasm, to purchase military glory under the ramparts of RHODES, whose relief was helped forward by the various jarring interests of European Princes; <Sententia>for it is a just observation, that turbulent busy spirits are more easily <i>evaporated</i> than <i>confined</i>.</Sententia>

A potent Aristocracy at home had at that period considerably weakened <i>each</i> Monarch in Europe; therefore <i>all</i> Monarchs saw, that it was their <i>common</i> interest, and each one felt it to be his own <i>particular</i> interest, to cut out <i>distant work for formidable Barons</i>. These petty tyrants were in most cases found so <i>oppressive</i> to the lower orders, as <i>dangerous</i> to their Sovereigns, against whose power they inveighed with a <i>bitterness</i>, generally proportioned to the <i>despotism</i> they themselves practiced on their own dependents.

To the genius of <i>Crusade</i>, therefore, were the Sovereigns of EUROPE much indebted for their deliverance from the encroachment of powerful subjects, who thought <DoxaQuotes>"they had a <i>right</i> to as much liberty as <i>they could get</i>."</DoxaQuotes>

The reigning Grand-master, D'AUBUSSON, provided with celerity, for a vigorous defence; accordingly the infidel army, on its first appearance off this island found a city prepared to resist the attacks of a more formidable foe. In aid of these exertions were to be reckoned the gallant enthusiasm of the times; and lastly, papal indulgences granted (with a lavish hand by Sixtus the Fourth, at the instance of Lewis the Eleventh of France) to all who should contribute <i>pecuniary assistance</i> to the Knights of RHODES, whose coffers (exhausted by perpetual and unprofitable wars) were thus speedily and amply replenished.

It was in the end of APRIL that the Turkish fleet was descried in the Offing, standing in for the shore: a heavy, canonade soon commenced, which was briskly returned by the citadel, and from the ramparts of RHODES: after sustaining a long action, the enemy, though with very great difficulty, effected a landing, both of cavalry and infantry and these troops speedily intrenched themselves on the hill of Saint STEPHEN, on which their batteries were no sooner mounted, and well appointed, than the city was summoned to surrender. But <i>promises</i> and <i>threats</i> proving alike ineffectual, the horse made a sally from their intrenchments, and came up to the very gates. Of this excursion, they had, however, soon cause to repent; for MONTMORIN, at the head of a squadron of light cavalry  making a <i>sortee</i>, routed and pursued them to the very ditch of their camp. Among the slain on this occasion was found the notorious renegado DEMETRIUS, who fell, <i>not</i> by the sword of the pursuers, but by the accident of his horse stumbling in fight, and his own troops riding over him.

MONTMORIN returned unhurt himself, and with a very inconsiderable loss of his men, save only the death of a gallant Knight, named MURAT, a cadet of the illustrious house of Le TOURS.

The besiegers, wearied with repeated and indecisive skirmishes, employed a GERMAN engineer (who had been long in their service) to reconnoitre, and to advise how best to direct the whole fire of their artillery. This task was soon accomplished, and the Bashaw PALEOLOGUE pointed his batteries (by the renegado's advice) against the tower of St. NICOLAS. The Turkish Generalissimo was at the same time, flattered by assurances, that under <i>his</i> auspices, an attack <i>so conducted</i>, would soon display the cresent on the battlements of RHODES.

The Grand-master, with a vigilance equal to his valour, used every effort to drive the Turks from their guns, and to dismantle their fortifications; and although he was <i>not quite</i> successful in his endeavours, yet he soon convinced the assailants that <i>they</i> had been led, to form expectations, much too sanguine, as to the event of their engineer's plan.

Of the strength of <i>one</i> tower in particular, experience convinced them, they had thought by far too meanly. A council of war was then held, the result of which was a determination to send this same engineer as a spy into, the town, to form an accurate opinion concerning the several bastions.

The faithless German readily agreed to aft his part, and accordingly presented himself before the ramparts in a posture suited to his pretences. MONTMORIN happened to be the first officer who observed him, and he afforded protection to the deserter; but it was with a hand <i>half</i> extended, and <i>half</i> drawn back.

To the Grand-master the cautious Baron instantly conveyed this suspected convert. D'AUBUSSON was then sitting in council with his principal commanders; to them the German professed the deepest compunction for the part he had taken against the Christians, most humbly suing for readmission into the bosom of the church, and for some military employment, whose labours and perils might bring his sincerity speedily to the trial.

The <i>religious</i> part of his petition was immediately granted; but he was strictly watched, because greatly suspected. On his examination he endeavoured to inspire the Knights with high ideas of the <i>force</i>, <i>appointments</i>, and <i>determined resolution</i> of the enemy. These artifices being seen through, could not fail to operate against his employers; and <i>that</i> day's council of war rose with a spirit of increased resolution: <i>Death</i> or <i>Victory</i> were the only alternatives with its determined members.

After little more than a week, the German was detected in conveying intelligence to the Turks, by means of a letter tied to an arrow; and he next day received the reward of his villainy, from the hand of his executioner.

With an almost incessant firing from the batteries, the besiegers laboured to effect a breach, which design they accomplished on the ninth of <i>June</i>. Their fury was instantly directed to the tower of St. Nicholas; its shattered condition encouraging them to hope that it would become an easy prey: but there they were again disappointed; for this post was <i>so</i> dangerous and <i>so</i> important, that it had attracted the attention, and insured the personal service of the most experienced, and most valiant commanders of the order. 

The command of the chosen band, which occupied this tower, was shared between the grand-master and two others, of most distinguished eminence; his brother, the Viscount D'AUBUSSON and the Baron MONTMORIN.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. IX.</ChapMarker>

THE <i>Turks</i>, although the surrounding atmosphere seemed kindled into a conflagration, in a frenzy of contagious courage, scimeter in hand, fix and ascend their ladders, as if totally insensible of the unremitting fire directed at them from all parts.

Probably the fury, and the perseverance, which on that occasion united in the assailants, would have proved too hard for any <i>defenders</i> but the Knights of JERUSALEM. 

MONTMORIN, who had early recommended himself to the favour of the grand-master, by fighting at his side, on this, as on every other occasion, displayed the most intrepid valour. CARETTI, one of the <i>Commanders</i> belonging to the order, standing close to them when D'AUBUSSON lost his helmet, respectfully intreated him to retire; he was answered, <SpeechInsert>"<i>This</i> is the post of honor, <i>here</i>, and <i>no where else</i>; therefore, should your Grand-master be seen. If I fall, you have much more to hope, than I to fear."</SpeechInsert>

The <i>eye</i>, and the <i>example</i> of such a leader, could not fail to raise such troops above the ordinary standard of military exertion. Towards the close of the action, the gallant heroes found themselves surrounded with a fort of rampart, raised by their own valour, and composed of the bodies of the slain.

The assailants now rendered quite desperate by the obstinate resistance of the Knights, endeavoured, by means of strong iron hooks, fixed to very large cables, to <i>pull those heroes down from the battlements</i>, that they might slaughter them in the trenches.

The grand-master himself was seized on by one of these hooks, and was dragged to the <i>brow of the precipice</i>, when his faithful MONTMORIN severed the cable with one stroke of his battle axe; then, with a well aimed arrow, he transfixed the breast of the Turk who held the rope. 

His bravery and conduct on this occasion served to raise him still higher in the esteem of the Knights; and in the friendship of the illustrious hero, whose life he had saved, and from whom (on condition of his assuming the habit of the order) he received the offer of a station at once <i>elevated and lucrative</i>. But here, the tender remembrance of the beloved HELOISE interposed, and effectually precluded his acceptance of any advantage or dignity <i>connected with celibacy</i>.

On the twenty-sixth day of July, the infidels, who had now lost a very considerable portion of their army, began and kept up a heavy fire against the <i>Jews'</i> quarter of the town: this attack continued with unremitting fury for twenty-four hours; at the expiration of that time a breach was made, at which, however, the impetuous assailants were not suffered to enter. At this critical juncture the Grand-master hastened to display the standard of the cross, an expedient to which recourse was never had but in cases of the extremest necessity.

The besieged, re-animated at this sight, returned to the charge with double ardour; they had, however, soon the mortification to behold the Turks become masters of the breach. The Bashaw, who had before this, laid a plan for poisoning the Grand-master, now set an immense price on his head; accordingly, twelve Janissaries undertook to <i>cut their way</i> to D'AUBUSSON, and they effected their desperate enterprize.

This gallant leader, of the unconquered Knights, received from them five wounds at once, and for near a minute, he was unassisted by his brave comrades; but his brother the Viscount, happily at the moment of the exigency, reinforcing that part of the garrison, cut the Janissaries to pieces, and seized their holy standard, which had been planted in the breach.

This revolution in their affairs being observed by the besiegers, they fled in wild dismay. MONTMORIN observing their flight (and being animated with an ardour, which the long continuance of the battle had <i>encreased</i>, rather than <i>abated</i>) was foremost in the <i>pursuit</i>, and followed the fugitives rashly, until (being surrounded by the retreating foe) he was taken prisoner, and carried on board the Turkish gallies.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. X.</ChapMarker>

HELOISE, after a tolerable passage, had arrived within sight of RHODES: on beholding, with longing eyes, the wished-for shore, she flattered herself, that all her troubles were now speedily to cease. The inconveniences of her voyage had neither been <i>few</i> nor <i>slight</i>; and a very serious and perplexing distress had arisen to her in the course of it. An unfortunate discovery of her sex gave rise to this --- the difficulties resulting from which unlucky accident were of a nature so embarrassing, as to require <i>all her quickness</i>, and all her <i>firmness of mind</i> to surmount them. In return to repeated and passionate offers of marriage, HELOISE had the address to make such equivocal returns, as left the Captain little reason to suppose that his happiness waited for any thing but the benediction of the church, which could not be procured before their arrival at port. To her importunate lover the fair fugitive had assigned her attachment to a favorite brother, as the cause of her disguise, and of her expedition. She represented her family at home, as harassed by a powerful neighbour, who availed himself of her brother's absence; and that she had taken this, seemingly desperate, resolution with a view of instantly recalling him from the pursuit of fame at RHODES, to the protection of his widow-mother, and defenceless orphan <i>sisters</i> at home.

The enamoured Captain (whilst indulging himself in reveries on his approaching bliss) was roused to attention by the sight of a Turkish galley bearing down upon him. The action soon commenced on the part of the <i>Turks</i>; and after an unequal contest of not many minutes, the French ship was constrained to <i>strike her colours</i>.

The victors having manned the vessel from their own crew, conducted her in triumph to the shore, where their fleet lay at anchor.

HELOISE (who immediately on the discovery of her sex) had assumed her proper habit, was, without delay, conveyed to the galley of PALEOLOGUE, there to await his pleasure. She now abandoned herself, for the first time, to the most poignant grief Her mind (softened by the contemplation of expected felicity) was doubly sensible of the cruel stroke that dissolved the visionary charm. Seated at the window of her cabbin, she now, with indescribable anguish, descried the walls of RHODES, and her terrors insinuated, that every <i>shot the enemy fired</i>, might deprive MONTMORIN of life.

A prey to these cruel reflections, HELOISE remained for some time, till the memorable defeat of the 27th of JULY determined PALEOLOGUE rather to risque the effects of MAHOMET'S anger, than another encounter with the Knights.

Accordingly, on the twenty-eighth he embarked, and on the following day spread his sails for his own shore, carrying with him and his ruined army, no other trophies than MONTMORIN (who, with all conceivable indignation rejected the offers made to procure his apostacy) and the unfortunate HELOISE, now sinking under the pressure of an intolerable weight of woe: the idea, that every time the oars divided the briny waves, they bore her still <i>farther</i> from all she held most dear, was little short of distracting. In these circumstances, still ignorant of her lover's fate, she received a notification from the Bashaw, that he meant to pass the night in her cabbin.

PALEOLOGUE, originally a Greek Christian of the Imperial family of CONSTANTINOPLE, had so far adopted the brutal manner of the Turks, that he made known this intention to his beautiful captive, without any desire <i>to engage her affections</i>, but merely to <i>possess her person</i>. To her, this message was terrible, <i>in the extreme</i>; she now considered her situation as absolutely desperate, and that <i>therefore</i> she was not only <i>authorised, but called upon</i> to have recourse to the most desperate exertion; accordingly, she resolved that the apostate should pay his life, as the forfeit of his crime.

<SceneQuasi>The Bashaw, on entering the cabbin, found HELOISE, seated on her sofa, with a dagger in her hand: --- a sight so uncommon made him start. He ordered his captive to <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"throw aside that instrument of death."</ReportedSpeechQuotes> Scarcely had he uttered these words, when a number of mutes appeared, who (by order of the second in command) arrested the unsuspecting Bashaw.</SceneQuasi>

The second in command who had given orders for this arrest, well knew the indignation that MAHOMET would feel against PALEOLOGUE, for having raised the siege; and therefore he determined by this step, to secure to himself his master's favour. On the removal of the fallen Bashaw, out of the cabbin of HELOISE to his own (where he was strictly guarded) she returned thanks to Heaven for her wonderful delivery; and considering this as an earnest of future help, her spirits revived, and she retired to rest. Unacquainted with the <i>whole extent</i> of her present good fortune, she knew not that she herself was now considered as <i>part</i> of the <i>confiscated</i> property of her brutal admirer; and that <i>on this account</i>, her person would necessarily remain inviolate, until the Emperor (to whom she now devolved) should determine her destiny.

A propitious voyage soon conducted into port the vessel which carried this rich prize, and MAHOMET delayed not long to confirm the disgrace of the Bashaw, who was, however, permitted to retire into exile, all his possessions having been first consigned to the Emperor's use.

HELOISE was, within a few days, sent for into the presence of MAHOMET, who (not being as much smitten with her as others had been) bestowed her on the successor of PALEOLOGUE, the very same officer who had put him under arrest for having given up the siege; by her new proprietor was the lovely HELOISE conducted to his Haram.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. XI.</ChapMarker>

MONTMORIN, in the meantime, was sold to a wealthy Mahometan, who, for one part of the year, resided at CONSTANTINOPLE, but for the other part, at a villa near the city. This master employed his new purchase in the lowest menial offices of his house, in which situation did several tedious months roll over the head of the distressed Baron.

During the siege; the perpetually varying scenes, the din of arms, and of martial music, --- these had banished, in some degree, from his recollection, the charms of HELOISE; but in the cheerless uniform solitude of adversity, her beloved idea was <i>more strongly</i> stamped on his yielding heart than ever.

His sufferings now naturally served to awaken in his anxious breast a thousand distressing apprehensions on her account, and on that of his family.

<Sententia><i>Business</i> is perhaps the very best human remedy against sorrow; but then it must be a <i>business that interests the mind</i></Sententia>, somewhat <i>more</i> than did the <i>occupations</i> of the unfortunate MONTMORIN.

Whilst the pensive captive indulged his melancholy reflections, his master afforded him some small relief by changing the scene of his employment, which was now transferred to the country, where to him was consigned the care of a garden.

CICERO, somewhere says, that <QuotedLit>"the pleasures of an husbandman are next to those of a philosopher;"</QuotedLit> <Sententia>but then the peasant must <i>not</i> be deprived of liberty, and he must <i>not</i> be far removed from his native country, <i>else</i> his pleasures will be <i>few indeed</i>.</Sententia>

The profound retirement of the villa soon became far more irksome to the love-sick slave, than the laborious life led in the metropolis; and yet, desperate as matters appear to be, the hour of his delivery drew nigh.

<SceneQuasi><Trigger>One evening</Trigger>, as MONTMORIN walked alone in the garden, he observed a man sliding down one of the walls; on perceiving that he was discovered, he endeavoured to return as he came, but (missing his hold) he fell. In this condition the Baron seized him; when the Turk drawing a dagger from his breast, threatened his antagonist with instant death, if he did not quit his hold.

MONTMORIN proving the more alert and able of the combatants, seizing the dagger, disarmed the ranger, who, from the <i>dress</i>, collecting the <i>condition</i> of his conqueror, thus addressed him: <DiaQ>"Doubtless liberty must still be dear to you; and (if you will assist me in eloping with one of your master's, wives, who now expects me) I will supply you with money, and facilitate your return to your native country.

"Here," <M>added he</M>, "is a bag of sequins, as an earnest of my future protection, and you may <i>instantly</i> become the companion of my flight."</DiaQ>

The proposal was readily accepted, and at the moment, appeared the expected fair one in the garden. She, and her lover, made their escape on Arabian steeds prepared for them, and which soon conveyed them beyond the reach of their pursuers; MONTMORIN (mounted on the horse of one of the attendants) being of the party.</SceneQuasi>

In a few hours ABDAD, the adventurous Turk, and his mistress, found themselves at a small country retirement, where the master of the house treated MONTMORIN with great beneficence, who, after a stay of three days, left his host and his sultanna happy in the enjoyment of each other.

Under the direction of a guide, the Baron bent his course towards the sea coast; the sun had not risen when he left the abode of ABDAD; and he diligently pursued his route, without any interruption, until he and his companion were driven, for shelter, into a cavern by the road side.

Here they reposed, till they were (by the evening's lengthening shadows) invited to prosecute their journey. Night overtaking the travellers on the houseless edge of a forest, they resolved to avail themselves of its protection, and to pass their sleeping hours amid the boughs of some lofty tree, that they might escape the danger, in those regions so common, of attacks from wild beasts.

<SceneQuasi>A stately tree presented itself, in the branches of which MONTMORIN was no sooner placed than he extended his hand to the guide, who (in the act of ascending) became the prey of a lion.

This beast lay sleeping at the foot of the tree, and being covered by the brush-wood that surrounded it, had escaped the observation of the travellers.

Piteous as were the cries of the guide, --- humane and brave as was MONTMORIN; yet, before any assistance could possibly be attempted, the motion of the lion's jaws declared the lamentable fate of the poor Turk.</SceneQuasi>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. XII.</ChapMarker>

HELOISE, after her removal to the seraglio of the Bashaw, who had received her from the hand of MAHOMET, found the wretchedness of her situation more intolerable than ever: she well knew that, when once the massive portals of that dire retreat are closed, it is <i>almost</i> certain that death alone can set the captive free.

A considerable time was suffered to elapse, and yet she had not any notification of the Bashaw's intention to visit her. He acted thus deliberately, from a flattering hope that time would prepare the way for his assiduities, and render the object of them less overwhelmed with melancholy.

In this expectation he was mistaken; for time (<i>unaided by succession of ideas</i>) served, if possible, to fix a melancholy hue more deeply on her mind: ignorant of the language of the country, she was deprived of the only comfort her prison afforded, -- being of course incapable of mixing even in the conversation of the Haram -- and her woe-worn mind, being totally unrelieved by any thing that could divert, employ, or amuse, naturally fell a victim to absolute despair.

<SceneDiaQuasi>The loss of reason soon followed, -- of which event the Bashaw being informed, he resolved immediately to visit his captive: on his entrance he found the lovely mourner talking incoherently to herself. Her expression of countenance had undergone a considerable alteration; her features had assumed that interesting cast, to which those who visit the residence of desponding woe are no strangers. She appeared ready to weep, but <Exclamation>alas!</Exclamation> her wretchedness was one, to which, the <i>relief of tears</i> is denied. -- She sighed, then turned her eyes to Heaven, as if to seek her lover there. -- Despair, (perhaps <i>hope</i>) called them back to earth. -- She saw the Bashaw, and with eagerness she seized his hand; and then exclaimed, <DiaQ>"Were you at Rhodes? I <i>know</i> you were: your hands are bloody; tell me did he fall? Oh that <i>this breast</i> had been his shield!"</DiaQ>

The Bashaw had been long a prisoner at Rhodes; where he became sufficiently acquainted with French, fully to understand the conversation of HELOISE; his ignorance of her story inclined him to suppose, that her affections might have been engaged by PALEOLOGUE; after listening, therefore, for some time (in silent wonder) to the effusions of her disordered mind, he, at length approached her; <AuthorialObservation>but with that reverence always paid, among the Turks, to persons bereft of reason; and, on that account, <i>supposed</i> to be under the immediate guidance of divine inspiration.</AuthorialObservation>

HELOISE once more broke forth; and (approaching the Bashaw) she cried, <DiaQ>"Take care! -- <i>You are at the top -- you an go no higher -- you will soon fall headlong ---- Beware! -- the rock begins to nod -- Hard, how the billows hoarsely roar! and lash, with angry wave, the rock whereon we stand! -- Have mercy! -- is </i>this<i> the rock of Rhodes? -- Ah no! --</i> That <i>was bloody -- Ah me! say, wilt thou bravely die, or basely live, a grovelling slave?</i> Oh! <i>my head and heard, are ill! -- Where is pity?</i>"</DiaQ>

The Bashaw convinced, that these, were the effusions of <i>inspiration</i>, failed not to interpret them, as predictions of his <i>own</i> approaching downfall.

<Sententia>Superstition, when it assails a mind merely <i>untutored</i> and <i>uncultivated</i>, has a tolerable certainty of success; but if it be <i>internally</i> aided, as it was in this instance, by the accusations of a guilty conscience, philosophy itself is insufficient to restrain its power, or to resist its attacks.</Sententia>

The Bashaw was conscious of the unfairness of those steps, whereby he had ascended to his present elevated state; and the recollection of his numerous host of crimes, served to dismay him effectually. At this moment, HELOISE burst forth -- <Dia>"<i>Away -- be gone -- I must to France -- he's there</i>"; <DescriptorQ>then, turning herself towards the door, the Bashaw ventured to divert her course, and to oppose her flight; but she spurned him from her with disdain, exclaiming,</DescriptorQ> "<i>There bleeds his headless trunk -- avenge him righteous Heaven!</i></Dia></SceneDiaQuasi>

The guilty Bashaw, appalled with horror, now gave himself up for lost; fully determined however to avert, if possible, the divine <i>vengeance</i>, by acquiescence in (what he considered as) the divine <i>direction</i>, he hastened to the port, where he agreed with the master of a vessel (then about to sail for France with a number of ransomed captives) for the passage of HELOISE.

<SceneQuasi>This done, he flew back to the apartment of his fair prisoner, and besought her to accept the opportunity he had procured her of returning to her own country. -- This proposal she heard unmoved, on which he took hold of her hand to conduct her. -- HELOISE turned from him with abhorrence, and bursting into tears, pushed him from her, saying, <DiaQ>"<i>Beware!</i> YOU <i>murdered him</i>."</DiaQ></SceneQuasi>

This awful admonition augmented the horrors of the Bashaw (who shortly after the <i>banishmnent</i>) had procured the <i>assassination</i> of PALEOLOGUE; apprehensive lest, the breast of MAHOMET relenting, his rival might be recalled. Under the most dreadful apprehensions for his own safety, the guilty Bashaw hurried his beautiful monitor on board the ship, (which lay waiting her arrival) depositing at the same time in the Captain's hand, a casket of jewels, said by him, to be the property of the fair passenger, but <i>untruly</i>, for they were <i>his own</i>, and were meant as an expiatory offering to Heaven.

The Bashaw returning in haste to his own house, now secured the moveable part of his treasure; and made a precipitate retreat to the borders of Egypt; leaving, to the disposal of his Sovereign, the remainder of his newly and ill acquired possessions. To <i>him</i> he addressed a letter, stating the motives of his flight, confessing his guilt as the murderer of PALEOLOGUE, and presenting to the world, one of the strongest proofs it ever beheld, of the intolerable anguish of an accusing conscience.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. XIII.</ChapMarker>

HELOISE unconscious of any change in her condition, still continued her sighs and her exclamations, to the no small astonishment of the Captain -- who (not having received any intimation of the nature of her case) found himself utterly at a loss how to conduct himself towards her.

The priest who had been sent from France to procure the ransom of those captives who were now returning home, by means of a most humane and unremitting attention to proper regimen, gradually, restored the fair mourner to the use of her reason -- She was then made acquainted with the various particulars of her own eventful tale, in proportion as she seemed able to bear the recital. 

An escape, so signally providential, could not fail to raise in the mind of HELOISE, sensations of the most lively gratitude to Heaven -- from whose gracious interposition she now hoped for a happy restoration to her native shores and perhaps also to her MONTMORIN. At length those shores appearing in sight, hope and fear, alternately, predominated in her anxious breast.

She hastened to disembark, and then eagerly enquired whether any of the neighbouring nobles had <FIDitalics><i>served at the Siege of Rhodes</i></FIDitalics>? Her question was answered in the affirmative; and the Baron DUPONTS was named as the Crusador whose residence lay nearest to that town.

Thither the anxious HELOISE instantly dispatched her faithful priest, to learn tidings, of the fate of MONTMORIN. Her feelings -- (whilst Father NICOLAS fulfilled his ambassage) could be but poorly expressed by words -- At one time, the objects presented to her imagination, were delightful and flattering -- but in a moment the survey was shifted, and despair pointed to the breathless hero, bleeding on the ramparts of Rhodes.

The return of the <i>silent</i> messenger put an end to her suspence: in his afflicted countenance she read her fate -- and the tear of sympathy, which glittered in the good man's eye, realizing her worst apprehensions, she fainted.

With difficulty was she recovered, and copious tears afforded her some relief; -- the compassionate ecclesiastic dreaded a second deprivation of reason as the too probable consequence of this dreadful intelligence. But in this conjecture he was most happily mistaken.

<Sententia>The most valuable metals are <i>softened</i> in that furnace whose heat <i>hardens</i> clay</Sententia>: the mind of HELOISE resembling the former, her susceptibility had been augmented by a series of poignant sufferings. The wound now received was deep; but its effects were less violent than might at first have been expected.

After some days of speechless woe she asked from NICOLAS the particulars of her Lover's fate. At first he shrunk back from the recital; but, at last, he communicated to her all that he had learned on the mournful subject: informing her, that after the Turkish troops had made a precipitate retreat from their last attack on Rhodes -- the too gallant MONTMORIN pursued them into the very heart of their own camp; where, with a few other daring spirits, he had met an honorable fate.

DUPONTS (knowing that all enquiries after the valiant Baron, had proved unsuccessful) hesitated not to pronounce him dead: a world (<i>whence he had been removed</i>) had no longer any charm for the disconsolate HELOISE; accordingly, she resolved to bid it an everlasting farewell.

To the convent, of which her friend was a member, she presented her casket of jewels to be sold; and the produce to be applied by the society, partly to the purpose of procuring masses to be said for the soul of MONTMORIN, and, partly to the redemption of Christian slaves.

Her next step was to enter on her novitiate, in the humane and humble order of <i>Grey Sisters</i>; in which she determined to spend the remainder of her days, employed in alleviating the sufferings of her fellow-creatures. Intimate acquaintance with woe had well prepared her disposition, (naturally compassionate and contemplative) for the discharge of this benevolent employment.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. XIV.</ChapMarker>

MONTMORIN, (after passing a night in the horrible neighbourhood of the lion) beheld the dawn of day, with unspeakable satisfaction. The first appearance of morning dismissed his shaggy foe to his den, and when the sun was completely risen, the affrighted traveller quitted his concealment.

Hastening to leave a scene so replete with horror, he pursued his journey towards the sea, from which he was still at a considerable distance: towards evening he directed his steps, for shelter, to a small grove, where it was not easy for him to find any tree, of sufficient bulk, to afford a lodging in its branches.

At length, however, he found, what he sought; and having ascended the boughs, he prepared to pass the hours of repose under this shelter. His sash he used to secure him in his habitation, (left in his sleep he might fall from his lodging) the loss of rest, on the preceding night, and his wearisome march, soon rendered him insensible to the perilous circumstances of his situation, and he sunk into the profoundest sleep.

<SceneAction>About midnight, however, the trampling of horses, and the voices of their riders, interrupted his rest; but not until they had gained that part of the wood where MONTMORIN had taken up his residence. He soon overheard enough of their discourse to learn their profession; a gang of banditti was what he had not been prepared to expect, and he had little inclination to offer his services as umpire, for the accommodation of an eager dispute, in which the fraternity were engaged, on the distribution of some newly acquired plunder.

From <i>invectives</i> the disputants soon proceeded to <i>blows</i>, -- but these were suspended on a proposition for leaving the spoil undivided, and under a guard of two of the party, whilst the others made a second excursion before daybreak.

The anxious inhabitant of the tree, conjectured the number of morroders to be not less than twelve; whilst they continued occupied in their noisy contention, the sighs of a female captive were drowned in the din of these ruffians. She had just fallen into their hands; and, about her, their principal quarrel had arisen.

The earliest glimmer of returning day, discovered to his sight this figure laying at the foot of a tree, her arms bound together; and on each side lay one of the banditti with a drawn scymetar: of these guards only one was awake, and he was endeavouring to avail himself of his comrade's drowsiness, for the accomplishment of his own designs on their unfortunate captive.

The noise which resistance to this brutal attempt occasioned, alarming the sleeper, he started up; if not to defend the helpless, yet, to prevent his fellow centinel from profiting by his wakefulness; and with one well aimed blow of his weapon (which was ready drawn) almost severed the head of his companion from the body. At sight of this horrid scene, the wretched female uttered a loud shriek, and fainted; in vain did the robber use every method within his power for her recovery. At length (taking from one of the packages of plunder, a small gold cup) he went for water, to a murmuring brook at a little distance.

At the instant of his departure, MONTMORIN slid down from the tree, and (arming himself with the sword of the deceased) expected the return of the robber, who, on his return was so struck with the appearance he beheld, that he stood motionless; and, undetermined whether he saw the <i>phantom</i> of the man whom he had killed, or an <i>Officer of Justice</i>.

MONTMORIN, however, soon convinced the villain that he was not a visitor from the other world. A stern summons to surrender himself, was followed by a contest, in which the ruffian lost one entire cheek: frantic with rage, he fought on for some minutes, and gave his opponent a severe wound on the left arm, at the instant before he himself received a decisive blow on the neck, which laid him breathless at the feet of the Baron.

The victor now flew to the relief of the still insensible captive; whilst thus employed, he was alarmed by the approach of horses, bearing, as he supposed, the remainder of the ruffians; here, however, he was mistaken, as this company confided entirely of a body of auxiliaries from the next village, who came in pursuit of the banditti, at the request of the proprietors of the pillaged caravan.</SceneAction>

The person who was found occupying the stolen treasure, naturally fell under the strongest suspicions of guilt; and therefore, his protestations were disregarded, and he himself was loaded with irons. His appeal to the dead witnesses was rendered totally useless, being over-ruled by the people of the caravan, who (although they had fled at the very first appearance of the robbers) declared that they had fought with them, and killed two of their number.

To no purpose did the captive Baron alledge, in reply, that two <i>headless</i> men could not have moved, and that the scene of the robbery was (by their own account) more than a league distant from the spot where these men then lay dead. As to the lady, <i>her</i> recollection was so totally destroyed by fright, that she could take no part in the debate; which lasted till the arrival of the peasants at their hamlet. Here the supposed accomplice in the robbery was produced before the magistrate, who (unfortunately happening not to have more sagacity than the owners of the carravan) could not discern the prisoner's innocence of the crime laid to his charge; and <i>therefore</i> committed him to prison.
