<SceneAction>In the month of August, a messenger arrived at Barnhurst Castle, with a letter which he desired might be instantly delivered to his grace the <ChNameNoIntro>duke of Clevedon</ChNameNoIntro>, as it contained matters of importance to him. It was accordingly conveyed to his grace, who was as dinner with a large party and his two sons tire the marquis of Huntley and lord Charles Sidney. 

On perusing the letter, the duke turned pale, and his countenance expressed an emotion of the deepest concern. He had no sooner made an end of it, than he apologized to the company for leaving them, but that a dying friend, requested his presence at the distance of thirty miles. He then ordered his carriage to be got ready in a moment, and, having desired lord Huntley to supply his place, went up to the dutchess while his orders were obeyed. Illness confined her grace to her dressing room; and, after a short conference, he threw himself into his chaise, bidding the servant take the road to <Cryptonym>D----</Cryptonym>, where he arrived late in the evening, and stopped at the door of a small but elegant house in that village. No sooner was his arrival announced, than an old female servant attended. <DiaM>"Is your mistress alive?" <M>said the duke in a mournful accent</M>.</DiaM> <DiaM>"She is, my lord," <M>replied she,</M> "and yet lingers to behold your grace."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Thank Heaven!" <M>answered he</M>; "conduct me to her, that I may receive her last injunctions, and view her once again ere life has forsaken her."</DiaM> As he spoke he ascended to the apartment of his expiring friend: he found her, with an anxious impatience for his approach, stretched on the bed of death. <DiaM>"You are come, my lord," <M>said she, in a voice rendered feeble by weakness</M>, "you are come just in time to make the last moments of a fond mother calm and peaceful."</DiaM> He drew near the bed, but words were denied him, for a short period grief seemed to check his utterance: he took the hand which she had extended to welcome him, and pressed it to his heart: <DiaM>"and is it thus only we are to meet!" <M>cried he in a voice of sorrow</M>, "am I to behold you but a moment, and no more!"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Alas! my lord," <M>replied she</M>, "the awful scene is closing, and shortly I shall be no more; but, for my child, my beloved Helena, I crave your kind protection:"</DiaM> then, turning to a female form who sat weeping by her side, she said, <DiaQ>"Approach, my child, and let me present you to your only protector."</DiaQ> The young Helena was overcome with emotion; and the duke in the gentlest terms assured her of his everlasting regard. <DiaM>"May, Heaven," <M>said he</M>, "forsake me in the hour of death, if I neglect the sacred charge you commit to me; I will cherish her with my best care."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Retire for a moment, my love," <M>said the dying parent</M>, "and compose your spirits, if possible, while I say a few words to the duke."</DiaM> Helena withdrew; and she pursued her discourse to her sorrowing and attentive friend.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. II.</ChapMarker>

<DiaM>"Ah, my lord," <M>said the dying lady</M>, "you then weep over the victim of an ill-fated passion! but I mean not to complain; the moment of dissolution is at hand, and I am about to appear before that God whose attribute is mercy; I trust! then, that, as my repentance is sincere, it will be accepted as an atonement for all my faults, blot but one guilty action from my life, and the rest of it has been spent in an humble endeavour to fulfil the duties of my station: let Helena find a protector, where her mother was forbid to accept one —- let her, my lord, experience your affectionate support against an unfeeling and a dangerous world; you will find her, I trust, worthy your regard, blessed with native innocence, and of a disposition to repay the attentions of a benevolent friendship with sweetness and gratitude; the dutchess is possessed of that winning sensibility and that gentleness of manners, which cannot fail of endearing her to all whom she thinks, worthy her esteem and notice; to her virtues, then, I commend my Helena, as well as to the powerful protection of your grace."</DiaM> —- <DiaM>"May wretchedness pursue me," <M>replied the duke,</M> "if I do not prove my affection sincere, for her too charming and unhappy mother, by every act of parental fondness for her lovely daughter! Oh! my friend," <M>continued he,</M> "in the grave only every anxious, agonizing care will be forgotten, together with every tender remembrance; you go to enjoy the heaven you have deserved."</DiaM> —- <DiaM>"I go, indeed," answered she, "to appear before that throne, where the secrets of all hearts shall be revealed, to receive a just, but merciful sentence; I die contented, to leave my child, my Helena, to your care: let me once more embrace her, and then I shall rest for ever! Farewell, my lord; may the Father of Mercies bless and preserve you, and all that are dear to you! This small packet contains a short account of myself, interwoven with some distressing and painful events; give it to Helena when you think proper."</DiaM>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. III.</ChapMarker>

Helena was now summoned to receive the last blessing of her expiring mother. <DiaM>"My beloved child," <M>said she to her weeping daughter</M>, "my support against the corroding effects of sorrow, the sweet solace of many a heavy, weary hour, adieu! may the peace of heaven dwell for ever with you! may the angels of innocence and purity watch over and guard the life of my Helena; from guilt, disappointment, and grief! may her days be crowned with the happy fruits of virtue and integrity and her death a glorious change to a better life."</DiaM>

Thus, in an anxious prayer for the welfare of her child, did this affectionate parent sigh out her last breath, and quit this scene of sorrow and disappointment: she sunk into the arms of her daughter, and ceased to exist. Helena was inconsolable; she pressed the lifeless body of her mother to her beating heart, she clasped her arms round the loved form, which had, while animated, bestowed the fondest caresses on her; she continued for some time in all the agony of grief, till nature, exhausted with the unusual struggles sunk into insensibility. The duke gave orders to have her conveyed to her own apartment, where every means was tried to restore her to life, and to sooth her spirits to a more composed state; but it was not to be expected that so great and recent a misfortune, and the just sorrow it had occasioned, would cease to occupy the thoughts, or harass the feelings of Helena; she continued violently to lament her loss, and underwent, painful emotions of both mind and body.

The duke shed the tears of unfeigned concern over the remains of her, to whose last accents he had attended with a pious respect to all they had enjoined, and contemplated with a mournful resignation <Sententia>the inevitable fate of mortality, the end of a being so much valued, from which neither riches, honors, nor beauty, (possessions highly prized, and anxiously preserved) can rescue us.</Sententia> From this silent, solemn view of death, he turned to pay the social duties of life, to contribute to the restoration both of the health and serenity of his ward, who, after a disturbed and sleepless night, had arisen, in order to seek the arbiter of her future fate. Overwhelmed with sorrow, she entered the dressing-room where she had been accustomed to meet maternal tenderness; now a dull vacuity augmented her sadness; she sat down and indulged her tears. The duke soon joined her; but finding her absorbed in her own afflictions, he silently seated himself, feeling too great a reverence for her filial piety and sorrow, to break in upon it with unmeaning consolation; his feelings were too delicate, and his sentiments too just, to offer the coldness of argument to a pure and rational tribute, paid to the memory of an indulgent parent by a virtuous and affectionate child.

When the first violence of her emotion had subsided, Helena looked up, while her face proclaimed her inward distress. The duke gazed on her, with an air of tender pity; he took her hand, and, with all the gentleness of a benevolent sensibility, spoke peace to her, <DiaM>"I will give you," <M>cried he</M>, "to the arms of one whose virtues and whose tenderness will supply the place of her you have lost: the dutchess of Clevedon is formed by nature to administer comfort to every one, to alleviate every misfortune, and to pour the balm of sympathy into every wound; you will find her all your fondest expectations can paint, and she has promised to be a mother to my Helena; I too will be a kind and indulgent father, and with us you shall learn to forget all your griefs: rest your hopes of happiness on my power and inclination to serve you; and, be assured, you shall not be disappointed."</DiaM> Helena listened with a grateful attention to her kind guardian, expressed her lively sense of his goodness, and felt somewhat relieved by his soothing care of her. But her grief was not to be subdued in a moment; <Sententia>the lenient hand of time, alone, heals wounds inflicted by such a melancholy, though natural privation of endearing intercourse.</Sententia> Helena had never felt the baleful influence of misfortune, till the hour which robbed her of her mother; for she had never known any other relation, whose death might have called forth her sorrow; she had spent her days in the bosom of retirement, moving in a very confined circle of innocent society, blessed with the approbation of surrounding friends.</SceneAction>

The duke, who was no stranger to the human heart, knew that time, a change of scene and objects, would work more towards a restoration of her tranquillity than all he could urge; therefore left her at liberty to indulge herself in all the luxury of grief, till after the last solemn rites had been paid to her deceased parent, and she was consigned to her native dust. In the mean time he settled all the affairs of the family, rewarded those domestics whose services could be no longer useful, and engaged the foster-sister of Helena to attend upon her, having fixed her old and faithful nurse in a small, habitation of her own chusing.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. IV.</ChapMarker>

Helena bad been early apprized of the duke's intention to introduce her as a constant resident, for the future, of his own family, and that her final departure from the village of D---- was to take place immediately after the funeral of her mother. She dispatched a messenger with the tidings of her misfortune, and a request to see the friend of infancy and the chosen companion of her riper age. Maria obeyed the melancholy mandate of friendship, flew to console her dear Helena, and agreed to spend those days with her, which were yet allotted for her residence in D—---. On the bosom of her youthful friend, she cried without restraint, poured out all her woe, and from her she received such consolation as innocence and virtue could bestow.

The day at length arrived on which Helena was to bid adieu to her peaceful, native home, to the dear joys of early friendship, and the less exalted rank in which she had hitherto moved. She exchanged with Maria a faithful promise to cherish and remember, while absent, the same lively regard which animated both when together; she gave each domestic a proof of esteem for their fidelity, and deposited in the hands of her friend a sum to be distributed amongst those poor neighbours, who had been accustomed to feel the benevolence of hers and her mother's spirit. Maria then, after many farewels, and having shed the tears of sympathy on the bosom of Helena, threw herself into her father's carriage which waited to convey her home, while the more splendid equipage of the duke drew up to bear Helena to her new and magnificent habitation. Her fellow-traveller did all in his power to keep up her spirits, on the change she was about to experience; and, in the course of their short journey, discovered qualities in his ward, which did honor to both, her head and heart: she exerted herself that she might not appear ungrateful to her companion, for the efforts he made to amuse and chear. They travelled with an attention to her health, which had scarcely recovered the shock so lately received, and reached Barnhurst Castle about six in the evening, to which place Helena was welcomed with every mark of attentive kindness, by its benevolent and polite lord.

The extreme youth and beauty of the fair orphan, together with the most touching air of melancholy spread over her whole appearance, rendered her an object of pity and admiration. Her light auburn hair fell in ringlets on her deep mourning habit, and contributed to make her figure peculiarly interesting. <SceneDia>The duke, taking her hand, led her to the dutchess. She wiped the starting tear from her eye, and prepared herself to behold one who was to supply the place of her dear indulgent mother. In a few moments she found herself in the presence of the most engaging figure she had ever seen. The dutchess rose from a sopha to receive her, and the tendered benevolence played on her features, which, with a complexion faded only by sickness, yet proclaimed its pristine beauty and delicacy: <DiaM>"Receive this child, madam," <M>said the duke</M>, "with your wonted goodness; it is she for whom I bespoke your favour and protection."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Most willingly," <M>replied the dutchess</M>; "your grace's recommendation is always sufficient, but here it is almost unnecessary; for the countenance of your fair friend creates a powerful prepossession in her favour: come," <M>continued she, taking the hand of Helena</M>, "let me intreat you to feel yourself at home, and consider me as one happy to contribute to your ease and pleasure."</DiaM> Helena, covered with the blush of timidity, returned such expressions as naturally flow from a grateful temper. <DiaM>"I am much indebted to you," <M>said her grace to the duke</M>, "for providing me with a companion who promises me a delightful relief from reflections on that unpleasant state of confinement which my health frequently requires; not that I either wish or intend to bury my youthful companion in a sick room; the enjoyment of those elegant pleasures we shall be able to procure, will I hope give an agreeable variety to the scene."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Where are my sons," <M>asked the duke</M>, "shall I not see them?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"I prevailed upon them, and Mr. Nowel, to take a ride," <M>replied the dutchess</M>, "as I thought it would be less disagreeable to Miss Sidney if I received her alone, as we were all strangers to her; but I must tell you, that my companions have exerted all their powers of entertainment to amuse me in your absence; they have alternately read, sung, played, and conversed, and, by the amiable tempers they possess, have rendered themselves equally the objects of my affection."</DiaM> <DiaM>"This harmony," <M>answered the duke</M>, "constitutes the greatest felicity of my life; may it ever continue."</DiaM> The dutchess then rang for tea, saying, <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"it was time the travellers should have some refreshment after their journey."</ReportedSpeechQuotes> As soon as the servants had obeyed her orders, <ChNameIntro><ArrivalDeparture>lord Charles</ArrivalDeparture></ChNameIntro> entered the room; he was a blooming youth, of about eighteen, fresh as the opening morn, gay as the season of his life, with a mien open and noble as his birth; his eye was fixed, not rudely, on the beauteous stranger, while he addressed himself to the duke. <DiaM>"My dear boy," <M>said his father</M>, "you're well encountered, I rejoice to see you; but where is your brother and Mr. Nowel?"</DiaM> The question was scarcely asked, and not answered, <ArrivalDeparture>ere they appeared.</ArrivalDeparture> <ChNameIntro>Lord Huntley</ChNameIntro>, the son of a former marriage, and several years older than lord Charles, was

<QuotedLit>"Tall as the pine amidst inferior tree,
With all the bending oziers pliant care."</QuotedLit>

His ride had dishevelled his hair, and printed his cheek with the vivid glow of health, his dark hazel eyes betrayed the movements of his soul, and his voice broke on the ears with sounds of the fullest melody. When he had spoken to the duke, he turned to the dutchess and said, <DiaQ>"will you, madam, do me the favour of introducing me to your friend?"</DiaQ> —- <DiaM>"Most certainly, my dear Henry," <M>replied she</M>, "and I hope my sweet Helena will become dear as a sister to you, for she is my adopted daughter."</DiaM> Helena blushed, and lord Huntley answered, <DiaQ>"if Miss Sidney will permit me to assume the relationship you promise me, I shall be most happy."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"I think," <M>returned the dutchess smiling</M>, "I shall find no great difficulty in forming that bond of friendship between two so dear to me."</DiaM> Helena replied, <DiaQ>"your grace and lord Huntley do me honor, but I know not how I shall discharge the duties of a sister, never having been blessed with so interesting a connexion."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"I will answer for your performing every duty with grace and propriety," <M>said lord Huntley, whose countenance bore testimony to the truth and sincerity of his expressions.</M></DiaM> <DiaM>"Am I," <M>cried lord Charles</M>, "to be excluded from my share of sisterly affection? I shall certainly quarrel with you," <M>continued he to Helena</M>, "the moment we become acquainted, if you do not distribute your regard equally."</DiaM> Helena, with the smile of pleasure, answered his threat, with all the modesty of unassuming gentleness; and before the close of the evening, found herself more acquainted with every individual of the family, than she could have supposed a month would have accomplished.</SceneDia> Mr. Nowel, lord Charles's tutor, was a well-bred, sensible man, and treated with that respect and attention which, was due to him as a gentleman, and a man whose learning and abilities had rendered the supports of an antient and noble house, an ornament to their family, country, and situation. Helena was entertained and improved by his conversation, and gratified by his attention; and her mind and understanding being naturally superior, and enlarged by a careful education, rendered her capable of receiving and profiting by the society and precepts of a family, in all respects amiable.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. VI.</ChapMarker>

<SceneQuasi>When the hour of separation arrived for that night, the dutchess turning to Helena said: <DiaQ>"Come, my dear, we will leave the men to settle the national affairs by themselves, and I will conduct you to an apartment you are from this moment to look upon as your own; it shall be sacred to your use, and whenever you wish to avoid company, you may be perfectly retired there."</DiaQ> Helena, after the usual compliments on parting, followed to her new lodging, which was in the same gallery with the apartment of the dutchess. The first was an elegant dressing-room, furnished with great taste: here she found books, music, implements for drawing, writing, &c. her bed-chamber was through it, and here her accommodation had been equally regarded. The dutchess then wishing her goodnight, told her she might either have her breakfast in her own dressing-room, or join the party in the breakfast parlour at ten o'clock.</SceneQuasi> <SceneConsciousness>Helena, when alone, had leisure to reflect on the happiness of her situation; and, while she still continued to lament and revere the memory of her mother, she felt grateful to heaven, which had placed her in a family whose virtues, rather than their rank, commanded her respect; her youthful heart, warmed by a kindness so salutary, admitted no doubt of a worthiness so conspicuous; and, though time could have given her as yet no right to pronounce on characters so new to her, the energy of youth supplied the place of experience, and gratitude prompted her to bestow her esteem where so much benevolence, and more than politeness, seemed justly to demand it. In a few minutes she dismissed her maid, and closed her eyes in a peaceful slumber; and her active and innocent imagination conveyed her on the wings of fancy to blissful and flowery regions, and where the hopes for the future, and reflections on the pall, were alike forgot.</SceneConsciousness>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. VII.</ChapMarker>

<ScenePerception>About eight Helena arose, and opening the shutters, discovered that her room commanded an extensive prospect of the country, and immediately overlooked the park and plantations, where art and nature had happily united to enrich and beautify the scene; and at a small distance she discovered, through the trees, a row of neat white cottages, which from their situation must belong to the Castle. The mansion, she was now an inhabitant of, was spacious and magnificent; though not modern, and all around it proclaimed the liberality and extensive possessions of the owner.</ScenePerception>

<SceneDia>By the time Helena had assisted her maid to unpack her cloaths, and she had equipped herself, it was past nine; she therefore bent her way to the breakfast parlour, which she found empty, but all appeared prepared for its soon being occupied; she took up a book that was on the table, to amuse herself till some one should approach, <Trigger>but she had scarcely turned over two leaves ere lord Charles entered</Trigger>, exclaiming, <DiaQ>"good morrow to my sweet sister, you look like the bright goddess of day emerging from a cloud; I shall" <M>continued he</M>, "be much mortified if I find you have long been here by yourself; I should have deserted the antients to converse with modern beauties, and left Mr. Nowel to study by himself. Could I have guessed who was in the parlour: has Huntley been here? but no, 'tis impossible, though he is a melancholy jaques, he never would have left your society for a solitary ramble."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Lord Huntley has not been here since I came into the room," <M>replied Helena</M>, "but I have not been quite alone, my lord," <M>said she, holding up the book</M>.</DiaM> "I could burn that book," <M>answered lord Charles</M>, "for its insensibility of the happiness conferred upon it; pray throw it aside, and make a book of me; you can't think what a fund of entertainment you will find in me, and you can have no idea of the pleasure you will bestow."</DiaM> Helena laughed while lord Charles displayed his good-humoured gaiety, and in the midst of his lively airs <ArrivalDeparture>lord Huntley came in</ArrivalDeparture>. <Dia>"What, Charles, are you playing monkey tricks to charm Miss Sidney?"</Dia> —- <DiaM>"your lordship's most obedient," <M>said his brother, bowing affectedly</M>; "Your cold formality will much more effectually charm her without doubt; she is my sweet little sister Helena, and if you come with a long face and profound respect, hoping Miss Sidney is well, I shall do no such thing I can assure you; I believe it will be some time before she recovers the shock of your frigidity."</DiaM> Lord Huntley smiled, and addressing himself to Helena, said, <DiaQ>"you see how soon we take advantage of your condescension; but I intreat you not to think me quite so mad as this young gentleman; I shall, I assure you, be much easier reproved, when too familiar, a gentle admonition will be sufficient; but I may, without incurring the imputation of formality, venture to inquire after your health, I shall be happy to have a confirmation from your own mouth of the hopes your looks give me, that you are well."</DiaQ> Helena answered these enquiries as they deserved, and immediately after the duke and dutchess joined the party, and took their places at the breakfast table, where Helena was deputed to preside.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. VIII.</ChapMarker>

<Blend>When breakfast was over,</Blend> the dutchess, turning to Helena, asked her, if she had any objection to take a ride with her; but desired, if it was not perfectly what she liked, that she would not go out of compliment. Helena answered, <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"that she should not desert a society where she was so happy, when permitted to continue in it,"</ReportedSpeechQuotes> and prepared to attend the dutchess, who had ordered her carriage; the gentlemen's horses being also ready, they separated for the morning.</SceneDia> The dutchess and Helena proceeded to the white cottages, where a school was supported by the former, and a comfortable asylum afforded the aged and infirm a calm retreat from poverty and distress: their kind and excellent patroness encouraged the industry of the young, and protected the old from neglect, rendering each season of life happy by her bounty and well-directed attention. When this daily visit was paid, they again got into the carriage, and the dutchess ordered her attendants to drive round the grounds home. In the course of this ride, Helena was confirmed in the opinion she had formed of the virtues and understanding of her companion, whose manners were those adopted by a refined and elegant mind in an intercourse with the polite world; and while she had carefully given the highest polish to qualities of the most valuable kind, and added grace and dignity to a person naturally engaging, she had cultivated the virtues heaven had implanted in her bosom with the utmost diligence; and at the moment that she presented a woman of the first rank, and of the most finished address, the eye of a stranger might discover the benignant spirit of truth and benevolence. On this model of human perfection, Helena formed her own character; and in every stage of life she proved, that she had not been mistaken in her choice, or incapable of copying the good example before her; it was from a laudable ambition to resemble the shining virtues of her friend, that she was enabled to perform the difficult task assigned her, and conduct herself with a becoming dignity and resignation through the many changes she was doomed to experience: from her she caught the steady, constant, pure, and holy flame of religion, as free from the enthusiasm of a fanatic, as the languor of indifference; and as it regulated her actions it shone with mild lustre, and gave stability and consistency to her character.

On their return home, Helena accompanied the dutchess into her dressing-room, where they read till it was time to dress for dinner. When the whole family were again assembled, a chearfulness, without levity, marked the fleeting hours; and so much were they pleased with each other, that the gentlemen desired an early summons to the tea-table, till which time the dutchess and Helena were left to converse. The modesty and sense which displayed themselves in the latter, inspired her noble friend with an affectionate regard for her; there was a natural propriety in all her reflexions which stamped them with weight, and a simple elegance in all she said and did, that spoke the purity of her mind and sentiments much more than the most studied address, while a collected steadiness of temper was blended with so much gentleness, that the approbation and esteem of those who knew her could not be withheld from her; and nature seemed to have formed her, in all respects, to shew the world that her <Sententia>simple charms can surpass the powers of art, affectation, or any and every adventitious aid; that native truth and elegance will always rise superior <QuotedLit>"to fashion's pert tricks, and all the poor parade of taudry dress,"</QuotedLit> which her votaries substitute for nature's modest taste.</Sententia><

<ChapMarker>CHAP. IX.</ChapMarker>

<SceneAction>When tea was announced, the duke, his sons, and Mr. Nowel, entered the saloon; Helena took the office of tea-maker on herself, and the servants were dismissed, to banish form. When this repast was at an end, a walk was proposed, and all but the dutchess sallied forth: the duke charged his sons to be careful of Helena, and not fatigue her; he then set out with Mr. Nowel, to take a strole, and left the young party to themselves. Lord Charles replied to his father's caution, <DiaQ>"don't fear, my lord, we will conduct our sister to flowery paths alone, and restore her safe —- I answer for both Huntley and myself; but pray, Harry, why don't you let us hear what gallant and smart things you can say on this occasion?"</DiaQ> <DiaM>"My dear Charles," <M>said his brother</M>, "you are quite smart enough for both of us; but, without, any attempt to leave the common road of expression, I will venture to promise, that our sweet sister shall return safe, and that I am most happy in being allowed to offer my services to guard her from danger."</DiaM> Helena, attended so well, set forward on her walk, in which she was directed and entertained by her companions; the sprightly humour of lord Charles was agreeably contrasted with the more manly conversation of lord Huntley, whose genius shone with as warm, though a milder lustre, on all he uttered; his delicacy and refinement were conspicuous; he chose such subjects as proved that his sense was solid, his accomplishments brilliant, and his heart the centre of truth and sensibility, of humanity and honor. The fineness of the evening, on which the setting fun bestowed a golden sky, tempted them to prolong a ramble so salutary to health, so soothing to the spirit, so tranquil and delightful; and they reached the castle just as the last ray of light glanced on the world.</SceneAction> The evening, the morning, and every hour, endeared Helena to her new friends, and enlarged her gratitude to the beneficent power whose goodness had so confirmed her happiness. The family party was sometimes broken in upon by visitors, and visiting; but these interruptions only served to heighten the enjoyment of social intercourse. <SceneQuasi>Lord Charles, in order to celebrate the nuptials of his nurse's daughter, on whom he bestowed a fortune suitable to her station and necessities, projected a rural ball, to which some of those neighbouring families, with whom they were on terms of intimacy, were invited: Lord Huntley's early choice fell on Helena, as a partner in the two first dances, when, to her infinite surprize and embarrassment, he declared his passion for her in the most tender, respectful and unequivocal manner. She had, indeed, perceived that he sought all opportunities of conversing with her ever since she entered the same house; but his appellation of sister, which he always made use of when addressing her, had concealed from her observation his intention, and she had almost begun to consider herself in that degree of relationship to him; nothing then could equal her astonishment, when he professed himself her lover, and urged her to pronounce a favourable sentence on his avowal. A variety of new sensations rushed at once upon her mind, and kept her silent, till roused by his repeated intreaties to speak, she enumerated her obligations to his family, as powerful reasons to prevent her encouraging a regard, which, while it conferred the highest honor upon her, she was yet in gratitude obliged to decline. Lord Huntley combated her resolution, and at length so far overcame it, that she consented to consider herself engaged to him, provided the consent of the duke could be obtained. When this point was amicably settled they were obliged to separate; Helena to perform an engagement to dance with another gentleman, and lord Huntley to seek a partner for himself. Helena was pleased, confused, and absent; lord Huntley's spirits were more than usually great, and his eyes told Helena she was the mistress of his thoughts: when he came to turn her in the dance, his lingering step forgot the time, and unwillingly he pursued the figure and returned to his partner.</SceneQuasi>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. X.</ChapMarker>

A new and perplexing train of ideas now opened themselves to the mind of Helena; and that she had rashly consented to form an engagement, without having the sanction of those friends to whom she owed every thing, without having any claim that she knew of to their kindness, was not the least of her concern for this clandestine attachment; and while the rectitude of her principles pointed out to her the impropriety and ingratitude of such a conduct, an affection, as warm as it was disinterested, filled her bosom, and grew stronger each moment. Lord Huntley, eager to prove the sincerity of his love, let no opportunity escape him of testifying it by every delicate method be could devise, and to the penetrating eye of love, each day proclaimed an increase of affection. In this situation of affairs, the summer, or rather the autumn, insensibly declined, and Helena could form no other resolution, than a determination never to incur the displeasure of the duke and dutchess, by a wilful breach of their express commands; and though she could not divest herself of a fear, that they would not consider her as a proper match for lord Huntley; yet the affectionate regard they both displayed towards her, sometimes gave her a hope that things would turn out better than she could expect; and, when melancholy, from reflexions of a more gloomy cast, she ever found that balm so healing to a wounded spirit, in the converse, the tender regard, of her amiable lover, whose every thought was directed to secure her felicity.

<SceneAction>A short time before the removal of the family from Barnhurst Castle to Clevedon House in town, Helena, together with lord Huntley and lord Charles, received an invitation from sir Thomas and lady White, to a ball; it was accepted; and, as the dutchess never attended any amusements, either public or private, on account of her health, a near neighbour, and a friend of hers was desired to be of the party, by way of chaperone. Helena's dress on this, as well as every other occasion, was expressive of the elegant simplicity of her taste; and in the delighted countenance of lord Huntley she might have read the admiration which was visible to all the company. She was a stranger to the lady of the house, and was therefore introduced as a near relation of the duke's, which, together with her own person and manners, procured her respect and attention from a brilliant assemblage of polite company.

She had not been long seated, before lady White approached, along with a nobleman, whom she introduced to Helena by the title of lord Farnham. After this accustomed ceremony was over, he entered into conversation with her, and displayed a good deal of wit and vivacity in the subjects he chose to entertain her with; he requested the honor of her hand for the two first dances; she was engaged to lord Huntley. <DiaM>"The second then," <M>said he</M>, "may I hope you are disengaged?"</DiaM> she was, and promised to be his partner. His expressive eyes had declared how much he was struck with her, the moment she entered; and his pointed attention, the instant etiquette was obeyed, by a formal introduction, proved, that his admiration was not momentary: he placed himself by her, and never quitted his post, till lord Huntley came to claim his partner, and inform her the dancing was begun. She rose, and giving him her hand, a conscious blush overspread her face, and pleasure gave fresh animation to her features: this emotion did not escape lord Farnham, who was no novice in the language of love.

Lord Farnham, having observed the pleasure that sparkled in the eyes of lord Huntley, as well as in his fair partner's, felt a restless curiosity for which he could not himself account, to dive into the sentiments of a stranger, for such Helena was to him as well as to most of the company. For the purpose of gratifying himself he contrived to stand next her in the set, and attended much more minutely to her conversation and lord Huntley's than to his own partner's; they could not avoid perceiving his observation, and joined in a wish that he had been placed at a greater distance; he frequently addressed his converiation to Helena in the course of the two dances, and so entirely deranged them both, that they were obliged to relinquish the pleasure of a converse so interesting and so sacred. At the end of the second dance they sat down, hoping to escape him, but he was not to be shook off, when inclination prompted him to pursue any object; he stood before them, and talked away, without appearing to see that his company was rather troublesome than acceptable to them, in the midst of a general discourse, which naturally followed, the obstinate perseverance of a third person to break in upon and disturb two people, who evidently wished to be separate from the rest of the company. Lord Charles approached, and accused Helena of idleness; <DiaM>"I will not allow you," <M>continued he,</M> "to sit down, when you are my partner, my dear sister."</DiaM> <DiaM>"What," <M>replied lord Farnham, willing perfectly to understand the meaning of the title lord Charles had given Helena,</M> "does your lordship intend to introduce the fashion of brother and sister dancing together? I think, unless every man was blessed with such a sister, <M>(bowing to Helena)</M> you will find it difficult to establish so singular a custom."</DiaM> <DiaM>"I grant, my lord," <M>answered lord Charles</M>, "that as few men are so fortunate as myself in this instance, I shall not be likely to make many converts;

<QuotedLit>But common rules were ne'er design'd 
Directors of a noble mind.</QuotedLit>

You must allow," <M>continued he, laughing</M>, "the truth and justice of these lines to be fully exemplified in me; so my sweet little nonpareil of a sister I crave the honor of your fair hand, that we may shew those good people what dancing is?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"This lady has done me the honor," <M>replied lord Farnham</M>, "of accepting me for a partner in the next dances, and 'tis a happiness I impatiently expect."</DiaM> <DiaM>"I fear, my lord," <M>said his lively competitor</M>, "I must relinquish, my claim in favour of your foresight, which prompted you to take the opportunity of engaging the sly little enemy of our peace, before we could approach her; but beware, my lord, beware of the poison that darts from her eye, for, if it once invade you, 'twill be vain to hope a cure."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Indeed," <M>replied Helena</M>, "I did not expect, that you would give me so bad a character; I am tempted to apply that old adage which says, that we bring our greatest enemy from home."</DiaM> Lord Farnham said, that he was fully sensible of his danger, but found it impossible to fly, <DiaM>"and, if I mistake not," <M>continued he</M>, "I only share in the ruin;"</DiaM> <DescriptorQ>and he glanced a significant look upon lord Huntley, who answered,</DescriptorQ> <DiaQ>"I think your lordship has deserved the fate you have provoked; for, like an imprudent general, you have pursued the defeat that threatened the first onset."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"You have made a most tremendous creature of me," <M>said Helena, rising to obey the signal for renewing the set:</M></DiaM> lord Farnham accompanied her, and lord Huntley and his brother walked away. Helena, during her engagement with this noble lord, was obliged to submit to his pointed observations and assiduous endeavours to render himself agreeable to her, a circumstance he could have little doubt of, from the general success that attended him, when conversing with every other woman: but here he was disappointed; for the unprejudiced discernment of his partner discovered that vanity was the ruling principle of his lordship's mind and actions; and, while she felt disgusted at the complimentary strain of his discourse, she most heartily despised the motive which procured her the notice of this fashionable Adonis; for it was certain, that lord Farnham was endowed by nature with an engaging exterior, nor was he destitute of understanding.

At supper, though Lord Huntley sat on one side of Helena, lord Farnham placed himself on the other; and if she had not felt teased by the constant and confident attention of a man she disliked, the evening would have ended rather pleasantly than otherwise; for his remarks were just and entertaining; and she was forced, in opposition to a gravity she resolved to maintain, to approve some of his sallies, by a risibility it was impossible to control. She was not however sorry, when the lady she came with rose to return home, and lord Huntley most willingly led her to the carriage. Fatigue was an impediment to conversation; and the party in the coach almost silently set down their companion, and proceeded to the castle, where they enjoyed sweet repose, augmented by the exercise each had taken in the course of the evening.</SceneAction>

The day now approached, on which the duke and dutchess had fixed for a removal of the family from Barnhurst Castle to London; winter had shed its hoary mantle on the world, and converted the lively scenes of summer, and the rich and variegated face of autumn into a dreary waste; warning such as preferred the busy hum of men, the noisy city, or the brilliant court, to be gone, and leave the desolated country to these, whom inclination, circumstance, or convenience, fixed in retirement. Helena was with the rest transported in a short time to Clevedon House; where an apartment, equally elegant with that she had occupied at Barnhurst Castle, was allotted her. She was now on the point of entering a scene of life perfectly novel to her; her education had been begun and finished in the country; where, though her companions were of sufficient rank and fortune, to banish the vulgarity of the lower order of people, yet they could give her but a very faint idea of the manners and customs of the ton, a lesson she could not learn at Barnhurst Castle; because its inhabitants preferred <AuthorialObservation>the plain but elegant manners of good sense, which, upon a minute observation, will be found to have little or no affinity to ton</AuthorialObservation>. She had much to acquire in the vocabulary of fashion; and, if she had thought it necessary to become a votary to that fickle deity, it would have proved a work of time, to undo all that Nature, in her bounty, had done for her: <Sententia>for so little resemblance is there to be found between them, that the beauties, the graces, and perfections of one, must be relinquished to preserve the other.</Sententia> Helena, however, having the example of a woman of the third rank, and one universally respected and admired, constantly before her, together with her own excellent understanding to direct her, fell not into the extreme of the reigning fashion, but contented herself with a very moderate share of the graces bestowed by the goddess of whim. Preparations were immediately made by the dutchess, for the entrance of her young friend into the world, with all that eclat her own merits demanded, and her situation and relationship to the duke, made necessary. Lady Egerton, a woman of character, and of an extensive acquaintance, was chosen by the dutchess to introduce Miss Sidney; who, together with lord Huntley, accompanied her to all public places. Lord Charles and Mr. Nowel having taken leave for the present to reside at Cambridge, where the former went to finish his studies, and the latter attended him as tutor and friend.

<SceneQuasi>The first appearance Helena made in public was at the opera; and the first person she encountered was lord Farnham; whose pleasure at seeing her, was displayed, not only in expressions of joy, but countenance. He said every thing that politeness could dictate on the occasion; and, being perfectly acquainted with lady Egerton, made himself one of the party. Helena was delighted with the music, to which she listened with as much attention as her talkative neighbours would allow; but, as a repetition of every part of the performance had rendered it almost insipid to lord Farnham, he made several attempts to disengage the mind of Helena from what passed upon the stage; but the novelty, the variety, the harmony, and the activity exhibited there, entertained her much more than the conversation of a man who forced himself upon her attention. Lord Huntley had been unavoidably engaged in conversation with several gentlemen and ladies, so that Helena had little of his company during the evening. When the dancing was over, they, following the stream, went into the coffee-room; to which place lord Farnham conducted Helena, while lord Huntley took care of lady Egerton. Some gentlemen who stood near them, asked lord Farnham if he had ever seen the dance better performed? <DiaM>"Upon my soul!" <M>replied his Lordship</M>, "I have seen but one object this evening; could I bestow my attention and admiration on a set of people throwing themselves into ridiculous attitudes, when a divinity was placed within my view."</DiaM> This warmth of expression attracted the notice of the party to whom it was addressed; and the speaker's eyes directed them for an explanation to Helena; she had overheard him, and was quite confused by the speech, as well as the accurate survey of the whole set who had heard it. Lady Egerton was very deep in conversation with some of her acquaintance; and, as Helena could not quit the place without her, she was obliged to undergo a distressing enquiry of the eyes, as well as tongues of an inquisitive set of people, whom neither good manners nor good nature restrained from gratifying themselves at her expence. At length her chaperone was disengaged, and they retired, to the no small relief of Helena, who was equally rejoiced, to leave a disagreeable crowd, and the man whose absurd behaviour had drawn so many eyes upon her.</SceneQuasi> When she compared his conduct with lord Huntley's, how did the character of the latter rise upon her; and how much did the other lose by the comparison: the admiration of one was silent, delicate, and insinuating; that of the other distressing, loud and offensive. <SceneQuasi>The next evening the papers announced Mrs. Siddons, in the character of Belvidera; and Helena, eager to behold this greatly and justly admired actress, accepted lady Egerton's invitation to accompany her to the theatre. At the usual hour, that lady called upon her; and lord Huntley also took a place in her carriage. Helena was placed between her two companions, in a front seat; and could not help congratulating herself on the absence of lord Farnham; when, hearing the box door open, she involuntarily turned to look who came in, and beheld the very man she had flattered herself was not in the house. He placed himself behind her, and joined in the conversation, till Mrs. Siddons appeared. Then attention was chained to the stage, where the united powers of voice, countenance, grace, and energy, called forth by turns each passion of the audience. <Sententia>'Tis her's to rouse the most dormant, or melt the moil inflexible soul;

<QuotedLit>"With matchless skill,
To turn and rend the passions at her will."</QuotedLit></Sententia>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. XIV.</ChapMarker>

The feelings of Helena were wrought up to agony, and visibly paid that tribute to the merit of Mrs. Siddons, she so well deserves. Lord Farnham exclaimed as her tears fell, <DiaQ>"Oh those precious drops! who would not really suffer torture to be so lamented!"</DiaQ> <DiaM>"My lord," <M>replied Helena</M>, "can you talk when Mrs. Siddops is acting?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Can I be silent, you should rather ask me, when I behold you display the most captivating sensibility?" <M>returned he</M>.</DiaM> By not answering him, and interesting herself in the play, he could find no other opportunity of speaking, till it was over; and then she intreated lady Egerton's leave to go home: it was granted; and lord Huntley went to order the coach to be called up. No sooner had that nobleman left his seat, than it was occupied by lord Farnham, who did not omit the opportunity of the absence of his too much favoured rival, to endeavour to render himself as agreeable to Helena. She listened with a great degree of patience; and almost resolved to shun those places of public resort, where a meeting with him was unavoidable. Lord Huntley, however, soon relieved her from her troublesome neighbour, by his return to inform her, that the coach was ready: he took her hand to convey her to it, and they found themselves quickly seated at supper in Clevedon House, where the evening concluded with harmony.</SceneQuasi>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. XV.</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia>When Helena and lord Huntley were gone, lord Farnham took one of the vacant seats, and entered into conversation with lady Egerton, in praise of the fair stranger, whose beauty, accomplishments, and blindness to the merits lord Farnham's vanity told him he possessed, were equally the subject of that nobleman's thoughts: he enquired if lady Egerton knew who she was; and particularly, whether a matrimonial connection between her and lord Huntley was likely to take place. That lady was as ignorant as himself of the birth or situation (in the Clevedon family) of Helena; she only knew that she was caressed by them with parental fondness, and acknowleged as a relation; as to any engagement between lord Huntley and her, the had never heard it; and his behaviour in public was that of an affectionate brother to an amiable sister, which he constantly stiled Helena. Lord Farnham had taken notice of this, and built hopes for himself upon it. Lady Egerton smiled at lord Farnham's curiosity about the lovely Helena; and he declared that he would marry her to-morrow, little as he knew of her real character or condition. <DiaM>"But," <M>replied that lady</M>, "should lord Huntley, dropping the title of brother, assume that of lover, and dispute the prize with your lordship, do you not think he would be successful?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"How cruel are you," <M>returned he</M>, "to destroy my hopes by such a suggestion; I rather think I should blow his brains out first, and then my own, sooner, than see him united to the too charming Helena."</DiaM> Lady Egerton laughed at this half serious declaration of war, and said, <DiaQ>"you are perfectly right, my lord.

<QuotedLit>"Such Helen was, then who can blame the boy,
That in so bright a flame consum'd his Troy."</QuotedLit>

But come," <M>continued she</M>, "since the fair Helena is not here, may I request your lordship to conduct me in safety to my carriage?"</DiaQ> She rose; and he having said he should be happy in the honor, handed her down; and having wished her a good night, flew to forget his love and mistress, in the company of a set of convivial friends.</SceneDia> Temperance was not amongst the virtues of the peer; but wine proved too weak to remove the passion of love from his heart, though its strength had overpowered his senses for a time. The next morning he was tormented with a headach, together with a restless desire to supplant lord Huntley, to whom the fine eyes of her whom he adored were directed, with a sweet but animated expression in them. <ThoughtSummary>He resolved (after several struggles with himself to forget her) to pursue and conquer, if art or invention could aid him; and he was already possessed of attractions sufficient to win the hearts of the larger half of the women in the kingdom -- high rank -- a princely fortune -- a handsome person -- and elegant accomplishments: but to his surprise these had all failed to inspire Helena with a passion like his own, which received its birth almost the first moment he beheld her. He would not however despair, having so often succeeded.</ThoughtSummary>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. XVI.</ChapMarker>

Helena had now been more than a month in London; where by turns she had been elevated and depressed, charmed and disgusted: but the innocence of her own mind, which shrunk from the depravity she could not avoid seeing and hearing of, afforded her, when her reflections turned upon herself, that sweet peace, the offspring of virtue, which dwells only with the good, and is cherished by truth and honor. Her acquaintances were numerous, her intimates few; not that the cold caution of age prevented her forming a friendship with some of her own sex; but, amidst the dissipation which surrounded her, she could discover no one woman, whose character, as far as she could judge, gave her any hopes of meeting with a heart sincere as her own; an understanding to separate folly from rational amusement; or stability enough to preserve inviolate the sacred bond of friendship, free from the caprice of youth, the extravagance of affectation, passion and weakness, or the cabals and scandal of modern friendships. She contented herself then with the common forms of politeness; and conversed with the young ladies the frequently met in company, on the occurrences of the day; feeling, that to attempt a more sensible and interesting style of conversation, would, while it exposed their ignorance, create their contempt; and only serve to mortify herself, by a failure in her design. The animation and intelligence of her own mind, when in these insipid parties, sometimes wanted objects to exercise it; but then her return to Clevedon House, gave her all that refined accomplishment, solid sense and unlimited affection could bestow; joined to an approbation of her conduct and manners, the most flattering. If ever she felt a pang, it was caused by a deviation from that openness and sincerity, which marked her character on every other occasion, in concealing a passion, whose foundation was virtuous; but which bore the stamp of ingratitude and impropriety, from the secrecy observed. She was ignorant till she came to London, of even the name of vices, which there seemed to be not only tolerated; but encouraged. She had once or twice seen in the public papers, an account of women who had disgraced themselves and families; deserted their husbands and children; and resigned themselves to infamy; but these examples, her native love of virtue, induced her to believe were few; and as she read the tale of vice, she pitied the unhappy victims of a licentious passion, heaved a sigh for the misfortunes such a conduct entails on the wretched object of public, and, she conceived, universal contempt; and breathed a wish, pious and fervent, for the honor of her sex, and that it might be no more stained, by weak and wicked women. What then was her astonishment, when almost every society in which she was present, discoursed with indifference on the frequent and shameless breach of marriage vows, of every law divine and human; spoke of intrigues as common incidents; of elopements, as things of course; of divorces, as a happy separation of two people who, were tired of each other, and scrupled not, by the vilest means, to obtain a release from the galling chain of matrimony, put on indeed with a thoughtless levity, and a total disregard of the sacred duties required. She shuddered to hear of a woman, whose daring effrontery braved the public censure; nay could appear before a court of justice, who were to sit in judgment on her character, and with intrepidity and an unblushing face, hear herself accused of crimes she rather sought to aggravate than extenuate; nay, would even recapitulate a series of misconduct, which she should rather have died than been guilty of, and the mention of which ought to have filled her with remorse and confusion. Nor did she find more to esteem in the other sex; for almost all she conversed with and heard admired, seemed indeed endowed with a happy confidence in their own powers of pleasing; but, to Helena, an absence of every quality which should adorn the mind of man, appeared to be the most striking trait in the character of these sons of fashion; and where the most shining abilities were bestowed, report spoke of the possessor as banishing his understanding, drowning his feelings, and inflaming every bad propensity at a gaming table, or in an excess of wine, dissipating time and talents, which ought only to be employed for the good of his country.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. XVII.</ChapMarker>

But whilst Helena viewed the general depravity which had gone forth; while she lamented the little respect paid to virtue and a fair character; she beheld in the man of her heart, a noble assemblage of every rare and valuable quality; and her grateful bosom heaved with excess of joy, to feel herself the chosen friend of the most amiable of his sex -- <FIDambig>she was the pride, the happiness, of lord Huntley</FIDambig>; to him she flies for a relief from the unpleasant reflections occasioned by the voice of scandal; on him she rested for support and peace; and he had power to reconcile her to a world, she had almost learned to despise: his loved society was all she coveted; his conduct was a powerful incentive to virtue; for it was gentle, yet animated with a spirit, tempered by reason and religion; it was mild to inferiors, gracefully condescending; and to equals and associates, open, sensible, and interesting. Such was the man she hoped to spend her days with. Amongst the families Helena had been early introduced to, and whom the dutchess as well, as lady Egerton visited, was sir <ChNameIntro>James Sundan's</ChNameIntro>: lady Frances Sundan was lord Farnham's sister; and, but for that cause, Helena would have found pleasure in cultivating an intimacy with her; for, though too much devoted to dissipation, lady Frances was unaffected, good-humoured, and lively, and had taken a particular fancy to Helena; but the regard she professed, was not founded on a thorough knowledge of a character and virtues which could have justified it, but on a partial and lover-like description of lord Farnham; a representation which was sufficient to create a desire in his sister to be known to her; particularly as it was his wish to bring about an acquaintance, that might afford him many opportunities of seeing and conversing with the fair Helena. This very circumstance, which Helena saw must be the consequence of her friendship, or even frequent visits to lady Frances, prevented both: and she preserved a degree of reserve not natural to her, wherever she met that lady: but, like her brother, lady Frances determined to conquer by persevering; and left no method untried to get the better of Helena's distant return to all her advances. For this purpose, she called often at Clevedon House, proposing a walk, or inviting Helena to join some party to a public entertainment, or a select society at her own house. As long as it was possible, she declined accepting any of her invitations; as she knew that lord Farnham always made one of every party: <SceneQuasi>but one day, when lord Huntley was gone out of town for a short time, and the duke was engaged, lady Frances came to pay a morning visit; in the course of which, she intreated the interest of the dutchess to prevail on Helena to make one of a pleasant and small set of friends, who were to spend that day with her: she apologized for the shortness of the notice; <DiaM>"but," <M>continued she,</M> "I knew if I sent a card I should be refused; for Miss Sidney has seldom favoured me with her company, where I have been most anxious for it."</DiaM> She smiled on Helena, who could not excuse herself; but, with the concurrence of the dutchess, who urged her to it, she promised to accept the present invitation. When lady Frances had succeeded to her wish, she took her leave; and Helena at a proper time retired to dress; a task she felt little inclined to perform; as she reluctantly obeyed the dictates of good manners, in consenting to spend the day at sir James Sundan's. <Blend>When the coach was ready</Blend>, she took leave of the dutchess; and, with some degree of the vexation she felt painted on her face, she proceeded to her visit, and the shortness of the way gave her no time to overcome it; so that when the carriage stopped, she got out with a tardy motion; and the first person she saw was lord Farnham.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. XVIII.</ChapMarker>

He met her at the door of the apartment; and, in his usual complimentary style, accosted her. She returned his civilities coldly; and entered the room, where sir James and lady Frances were alone. But he was not to be discouraged; and notwithstanding all her efforts to avoid any particular conversation with him, she was at length obliged to yield to his importunity, and patiently suffer herself to be the sole object of his attention, though she was not a little provoked at his sister, for her duplicity in saying she was to meet a party, and no other person appeared. They sat down to dinner, only four: but, as nothing could exceed the attentive politeness of all the three, to render her situation pleasant, she found herself under a necessity of assuming a chearfulness, which, tho' natural to her temper, yet she did not then feel: but she had no pretence for being rude, to even lord Farnham, though his assiduity was to a painful degree troublesome to her. The evening confirmed the truth of lady Frances's assertion, by bringing in a few friends of both sexes; and Helena hoping to be relieved from the pointed and constant observation of lord Farnham, rejoiced to see them enter. She imagined that his politeness would not suffer him to behave as if there was no person in the room except herself and his sister; particularly as the ladies were young and handsome. But in this conclusion she was mistaken; for, besides that his lordship was perfectly acquainted with the company, he never sacrificed his inclination to propriety or good manners. Cards were proposed; and Helena, as well as having no taste for that amusement, supposed the game would be high; and she considered with a rational benevolence, which actuated all her actions, that the sum she might lose, would render several families happy, who were perhaps sinking under poverty, and every kind of distress; she therefore declined playing. Lord Farnham immediately declared he would sit out too. This she could not support; to be forced into a tete-a-tete with him, entirely got the better of her patience; and she said, if lady Frances would undertake to teach her the game fixed on, she would sit down to the card table. Lady Frances replied, that her brother was so much greater a proficient, and would take so much pleasure in the employment, that she could not think of depriving, him of it; and smiling, begged Helena would permit him to be her instructor instead of herself. Helena could not longer dispute with these determined enemies to her serenity, so quietly took her place, with lord Farnham for her neighbour. Elate with his success, he was in high spirits; and discomposed Helena so much, that she could scarcely endure to keep her seat. She kept continually reminding him of having undertaken to instruct her in the game; and endeavoured to stop the torrent of conversation, wholly addressed to her in a lower voice, which evidently attracted the notice of the company. When she found this method was vain, she seriously intreated him to desist, as he most cruelly distressed her; <DiaM>"and besides," <M>continued she,</M> "my lord, you cannot think it is consistent with common civility, to pay no regard to the rest of the party; and your behaviour, as well as being very disagreeable to me, is certainly very rude."</DiaM> <DiaM>"My sweet, my charming monitor," <M>replied he, fixing his eyes upon her face</M>, "how much more delightful is even a reproof from you, than the most divine harmony; but how can you think it possible for me, whilst I behold you, and have the pleasure of conversing with you, to think of talking to, or bear any other woman; and these ladies are so full of their own consequence and beauty, that my submission to the general plaudit, is unnecessary I can assure you."</DiaM> She found it was altogether in vain to oppose him, so tried to carry it off as well as she could. The dutchess had promised for her that she would stay supper, so there was no escaping; and after having spent a day productive of much inquietude to her gentle spirit, she returned home at a late hour at night, or rather an early one next morning, much fatigued in both body and mind.</SceneQuasi>

During the absence of Lord Huntley, Clevedon House did not wear its usual aspect, in the opinion of Helena. The days were long and tedious; and though the society of the duke and dutchess was ever pleasing to her, yet there appeared a dulness she had never before remarked. She wandered from her own apartment to others, in search of something to interest her, but found it not. She could not read; music was flat; work insipid; in short, she was deprived of her better self; and till the return of her faithful friend, she felt a lonely wanderer in the midst of society. <SceneQuasi>At length he appeared; the same delicate, affectionate lover he had left her, and hastened to present himself before her. She was alone anxiously waiting his arrival; but restrained by a just sense of delicacy and decorum from seeking him. He flew to her, and ventured to seal his welcome on her coral lips; the mounting crimson dyed her cheek,

<QuotedLit>"And on the ground her fixed, regards, were cast."</QuotedLit>

Lord Huntley overjoyed to behold all that was lovely in woman, and all that was dear to him at once, had forgotten for an instant the respect due to a purity he adored; and had, in the sincerity of his love, and the happiness of a desired meeting, so greatly confused Helena, that she was unable to speak; he in the gentle accent of intreaty, hoped she was not offended. She blushed still deeper, but could not answer. He took her hand, and exclaimed, <DiaQ>"Oh my Helena! let me conjure you to consent to shorten the term in which I am forbid to call you all my own. I will this moment unfold a secret, too long kept, (by your command) to my father; and solicit him to give me this hand, in addition to a heart, you allow me to hope is not adverse to my love."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"I have," <M>said the still blushing Helena</M>, "persuaded of your honor and affection, ventured to lay my whole heart open to you; and I will not affectedly disown its dictates; but I beg, I entreat you, not to speak your purpose to the duke yet; let me prevail on you to wait some favourable time; for I tremble to think of incurring his displeasure; it is my most earnest request that you will not make our engagement known at present."</DiaM> Lord Huntley tried to overcome her objections to having the affair disclosed, but could not succeed; and therefore consented reluctantly to be directed by her.</SceneQuasi> Helena newly restored to the company of a sensible, entertaining young man, whose whole soul was devoted tp her, recovered her wonted ease and chearfulness; and each day began and ended serenely happy; and peace shed its divine influence over all at Clevedon House. <SceneReadingWriting>One morning, when the dutchess, after a bad night, found herself unable to appear at breakfast, the duke, lord Huntley, and Helena, sat down by themselves. The duke, according to his usual custom, either rode, or walked out. Lord Huntley and Helena were scarcely left alone, ere a servant informed his lordship, that a gentleman requested to speak with him. Helena then remained by herself, indulging reflections of the most pleasing kind; when a letter was delivered to her, the contents of which soon dissipated the gay ideas of happiness that rose in her mind, and had filled her bosom with a calm delight. Amazement almost suspended her faculties as she perused it; and it was impossible to tell what passion was most prevalent; for anger, pity, indignation, contempt, and scorn, alternately invaded, as the following information unfolded itself to her.

<QuotedText>LETTER.

To Miss Sidney. 

Madam,

Having seen the God-like effusions of benevolence beam from your eye, and animate every angelic feature; I venture humbly to implore your pity and assistance; you will start with horror when you know that the wretch who has dared to address you, is an alien from the daughters of virtue, an outcast from society, an unfortunate and too guilty female, consigned to poverty and shame, to despair and infamy, by her unfeeling seducer. I tremble even for you, pure and innocent as you are, ignorant and unsuspecting of the perfidy of man; and I grieve for the necessity I am under, of being the unwelcome relater of the crimes of him, whose insinuating and artful address, has found its way to a heart like yours. What, most amiable of women, will be your feelings, with what indignation will you behold the name of Huntley, annexed to an action so full of guilt and mischief, so ominous to peace and virtue. When I affirm that lord Huntley is the author of all my calamities, I expose myself entirely to your resentment or mercy; for if you communicate the contents of this petition to him, his revenge would deprive me of every shadow of hope, which yet lingers to withhold me from an act of despair. In the wide world I can find no single individual to whose pity I can apply to, or from whom I could hope relief, except yourself, madam. O come then! and save me from the gulph which opens to swallow me. Come, happy as you are, amidst the storms of fate, blessed with conscious innocence, and unsullied virtue, and rescue the wretch who supplicates your charity; but be quick, or the cold hand of death will have seized its prey, and hurried me away with all my crimes past and unrepented on my head. Oh help me to resign my soul in peace, through the mercy of a Redeemer! and the miserable, the unfortunate Caroline, will never cease to pray for you. In <Cryptonym>---- street</Cryptonym>, No. 7, up three pair of stairs, you will behold the most forlorn of her sex; and a scene of real distress and woe, which your imagination could form but a faint picture of. Excuse the importunity of the wretched; and with your native goodness, pity and relieve the almost expiring

Helena was for some time rendered incapable of judging dispassionately on the contents of this shocking letter: at length recovering herself a little, she exclaimed, <Monologue>"It cannot be; I will not believe it: its a gross, unjust, malicious accusation; for lord Huntley is incapable of so vile, so base an action."</Monologue> She rang and enquired for him; but he was gone out. <Monologue>"I would have given him," <M>continued she, as the tears fell from her eye</M>, "an opportunity of clearing himself, and punishing his calumniator."</Monologue> She sighed, and could not determine how she should act; till recollecting, that while she deliberated, the unfortunate writer might expire. She rose up, saying to herself, <Monologue>"I will go and see this daring accuser; and I will make her own, that she has traduced my Huntley, and basely injured the most amiable of mankind; but I will reserve her from death if possible; and assist her to regain the path she has strayed from, and which she seems desirous to recover. I will point out to her the guilt of sullying the character, where virtue and honour are written in letters of gold. I will tell her, that his fame is above the destroying breath of scandal, and pure and unblemished; and to name lord Huntley and dishonour together, is a violation of all truth."</Monologue> These reflections ended, she ordered the footman who always attended her, to conduct her to ---- street; and having given him directions to wait for her, and not leave the house she should enter, till she came to him, set out in search of the unhappy Caroline, impatient to clear lord Huntley's character, and save his miserable accuser.</SceneReadingWriting>
