<SceneDia><DiaCutaway>"What a frightful situation! — The rock is at least two hundred feet above the lake. How could the wretched creature get to the very point of it?"

<Cutaway>In a moment, however, he started up, and swiftly fled.</Cutaway> "Oh mamma," <M>exclaimed <ChNameNoIntro>Julia</ChNameNoIntro>,</M> "he is a maniac!"</DiaCutaway>

<ChNameIntro>Annette</ChNameIntro> entered the room as her young lady spoke; and <ChNameIntro>Mrs. Mellrose</ChNameIntro> asked her if any mad person had lately come to that neighbourhood?

The girl stood to consider. <DiaM>"So sure as I'm alive," <M>she replied</M>, "it is the stranger from the mill. I wonder Madame never saw him before."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Has he then been there some time?"</Dia>

<Dia>"O yes: he hired the chamber three weeks ago."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Why did you not tell us sooner, Annette?" <M>said Julia </M>; "probably we could have assisted him."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Gramerci!" <M>cried Annette</M>, "I thought Madame must have seen him without me telling her. He has sat on that rock every night since he came -— True as I'm my mother's child; and nobody can take him from it."</DiaM>

<Dia>"It is a most dangerous spot."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Belike," <M>replied the girl</M>, "that is the very reason he chuses it: and two nights ago, when the lake dashed up against the rock so —- As Madame saw from these windows?" -</DiaM>

<Dia>"Yes."</Dia>

<Dia>"Well, he was sitting there all the time."</Dia>

<Dia>"Ah mamma!"</Dia>

<DiaM>"We shall see about him," <M>said Mrs. Mellrose, nodding an additional assurance as she left the room.</M></DiaM>

Annette looked mysteriously as her mistress shut the door. <DiaM>"What signifies all my lady can do for him?" <M>said she, with an air of sagacity.</M> "He has a troubled spirit."</DiaM>

<Dia>"How do you know that?"</Dia>

<Dia>"It's plain to be seen, mademoiselle. If he had not, do you suppose he would sit there, never turning his head no more than if he was made of wood? Besides, mademoiselle knows that if he was quiet, like other people, he would chuse to sit from morning to night instead of from night to morning."</Dia>

The surmise was sufficiently obvious; and <ArrivalDeparture>Annette being called away</ArrivalDeparture>, Julia was left to sum up her own conjectures.

<DiaM>"But he may not be incurable," <M>said she</M>, "and <i>we shall see about him</i>."</DiaM>

This was all the arrangement for the present necessary to be made; and she pursued her studies, which engaged her till the hour of dinner.</SceneDia> Julia was a living proof that impetuosity of native feeling and vivacity of temper can be accurately regulated without being subdued. Though often seated on the wing of fancy by the glowing spirit of an imagination suited to the scenes which surrounded her, the simplest or the most serious duties were not forgotten. Her mother had been her preceptress. With a steady hand and unremitting care she nurtured the blossom she had borne, and now beheld it ripening to maturity with the firmest confidence in its future fruits. Julia was not a common character — but Julia was of England. 

<ChapMarker>CHAP. II.</ChapMarker>

At dinner she would have spoken of the maniac; but her father was present, and in his presence she never spoke. She had been taught to respect him -- she felt that she feared him; but she could not love him. This was one of the occasional periods in which you would have seen Julia without emotion.

<RhetoricalQ>Have <AuthorWe>we</AuthorWe> not sometimes encountered characters which become more acrid when mingled with sweets?</RhetoricalQ> <ChPortrait><ChNameIntro>Mr. Mellrose</ChNameIntro> was one of these by nature, and by the occurrences of his life. By his own conduct he had sunk himself into contempt; and though he alone deserved the punishment, he deemed himself alone the sufferer. He attended the next <i>cabaret</i> unremittingly as the landlord himself, because there he found himself a great man. At home he felt himself a little one, and therefore he left home the moment he had finished his repast.</ChPortrait>

<SceneAction><DiaM>"Now, mamma!" <M>cried Julia, reaching her mother's hat, and tying on her own</M>; "now let us go to the mill."</DiaM>

This was the hour devoted to charitable visits, and they accordingly left the cottage. The descent from it was by steps out out of the rock, and, on looking down they perceived the approach of <ChNameNoIntro>the venerable Curé.</ChNameNoIntro>

<DiaM>"Ah!" <M>exclaimed Julia, springing to meet him,</M> "you shall come with us. We are going to enquire about an unfortunate stranger;" and she drew his arm in her's to lend him her support.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I guessed as much," <M>cried the old man, smiling with pleasure.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"How could you guess it, my good sir?" asked Mrs. Mellrose.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Because I know there is an unfortunate stranger to be enquired for."</Dia>

<Dia>"Then you have seen him?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Yes: but you cannot. He is now under the influence of a brain fever."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Mamma," demanded Julia, "shall I turn back, and send Gaspard for the doctor?"</DiaM>

The Curé replied he had already procured sufficient medical aid, and the event must now be left in the hands of God.

Julia, however, still wished to pay the visit at the mill. <Dia>"It is only in our road you know, mamma; and we shall reach the Major's in good time."</Dia> Mrs. Mellrose acceded, and they continued their stroll. 

On reaching the mill, they entered without being noticed, for the miller and his wife were earnestly intent on some slips of paper. <FIDquotes>"They could make nothing of them!"</FIDquotes> But on the salutation of Monsieur le Curé, and his companions, they concluded the difficulty already solved. <DiaM>"Madame will tell us what they mean," <M>said the miller's wife, presenting the <i>billets</i></M>.</DiaM> The good woman applied to the right person, for the Curé knew nothing of German; Mrs. Mellrose did. Her eyes ran over the lines in evident and increasing surprise, and Julia also, looking over them, appeared thunder-struck. The miller and his wife were curious to learn the cause of this astonishment, and eagerly listened while Madame translated the passages aloud.

<Dia><QuotedText>"I am become a wanderer once mores I am in the Pays de Vaud, Baron!"</QuotedText></Dia>

<DiaM>"Baron!!!" <M>ejaculated the miller and his wife</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia><QuotedText>"---- ---- from the windows of my chamber I have seen the only work of creation which is dear to me!"</QuotedText></Dia>

<DiaM>"That is the rock," observed the miller, nodding significantly.</DiaM>

Mrs. Mellrose proceeded to the second <i>billet</i>.

<Dia><QuotedText>"What a restless being is a man of strong passions, anxious wishes, and but half-formed resolutions! — My mind is quite unsettled."</QuotedText></Dia>

<DiaM>"That's plain enough, poor man," <M>observed the miller's wife</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia><QuotedText>"I fly from my chamber as if pursued by a phantom — Would, that I could fly from myself!"</QuotedText></Dia>

The Curé shook his head.

<Dia><QuotedText>"I am a strange creature, my friend; but you have allowed me a privilege to be to be so. I feel with gratitude that I have too often claimed this indulgence: but I have been unhappy, very, very wretched, and God and my own soul know that I have dreadful cause."</QuotedText></Dia>

Mrs.Mellrose looked at the Curé. <DiaM>"We must not judge harshly," <M>said he</M>.</DiaM> Julia half smiled, and Mrs. Mellrose proceeded.

<Dia><QuotedText>"I cannot describe the agony I at times endure — in one moment an intolerable weight of sorrow oppresses my heart; but that is the calmness of peace compared to the scorching flame in which at other moments it is envelopped. If I could shed tears I should be relieved — but the fountains of grief have long been dried up — I feel I am lost for ever — "</QuotedText></Dia>

Julia clasped her hands in the energy of compassion; and Mrs. Mellrose, much affected, observed, that the unhappy man must have encountered some dreadful calamity,

<DiaM>"And yet," <M>rejoined the Curé</M>, "he may not be criminal."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That's for certain, your reverence," <M>cried the miller's wife</M>; "but if he ever committed a murder, it was surely on the very point of that grey rock!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Marguerite," <M>said the miller</M>, "where's that round thing he peeps through?"</DiaM> She immediately took from the shelf a small morocco case, and on opening it, Mrs. Mellrose, to the great astonishment of herself and her companions, found it contained an opera-glass, most expensively enchased, and by an English maker. The curiosity these circumstances excited urged them to ask every question that could lead to any probable conjecture respecting the object of it; but all they could obtain was a repetition of the intelligence, that he came three weeks before; that he appeared very much fatigued, had asked a number of questions very wildly, and looked suspiciously at every body that passed by. That he expressed the greatest joy at finding he could get the apartment over the door, for which he paid some pieces of foreign gold; and that he went to sit on the rock every night, and returned from it every morning.

In confirmation of this the gold pieces were produced, -— they bore the stamp of Frederic of Prussia. The <i>billets</i> were in the German language and text; the opera-glass was English; but the miller was certain he was a Frenchman.

Nothing more could be discovered; and the enquirers took their leave, promising to give every assistance, spiritual and temporal, that could relieve the sufferings of the wretched maniac.

Mrs. Mellrose and the Curé walked on in earnest consultation on the means which ought, in this case, to be adopted; and Julia followed in deep thought on those which she eagerly wished might be pursued. <FIDambig>The noise of the mill must absolutely distract any one who had not been accustomed to it: besides, if this unfortunate man was at home, she could herself make broth and conserves, and a hundred things to restore him. The little blue chamber was quite in readiness: in a word nothing could be more convenient.</FIDambig> The affair was, however, finally otherwise arranged, <i>as it ought to be</i>.

Mrs. Wynneford met them on the grassplat, to scold them for their delay; but Julia was already hanging on the arm of the major, relating to him the cause. The angry lady quickly forgot that the cakes were growing cold, and the coffee in danger of losing its flavour; and before the repast was half over, she declared the poor sick man should occupy Henry's apartment. The major proposed to the Curé that they should immediately go to the mill and see him removed; and notwithstanding Julia's wishes to take upon herself part of the cares of his nurse, she clasped Mrs. Wynneford round the neck in a transport of delight for the stranger's preservation. In two hours he was an inhabitant of the major's house.</SceneAction>

There <AuthorWe>we</AuthorWe> may safely leave him to enquire who are his new friends.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. III</ChapMarker>

<AuthorI>I have already announced that Julia Was of England; and it may be conjectured that, excepting Monsieur le Curé, the whole party were also of England. In relating their pursuits, describing their manners, or delineating their sentiments, I do not address myself to the Duke and Duchess» of A——, or the Marquis or Marchioness of B——,</AuthorI> for the group here assembled had long deserted the circles thus enobled. They now trod an humbler, and to them a happier path: they sought for the pleasures of the understanding and the heart, and were so peculiarly blessed as to find them.

The youthful period of <ChNameIntro>Major Wynneford's</ChNameIntro> life had been spent in the vicissitudes of war; his maturity in gayer though perhaps not more tranquil scenes. His wife was his companion in both, for he had married at the age of twenty-one.

Several years however had elapsed before their wishes were answered by the birth of a son. When this event took place, their estimate of human happiness began to change, but they habitually pursued their course of worldly enjoyments till the voice of friendship called them to other scenes.

Mrs. Mellrose was one of those singularly gifted beings who, with the attractions of youth, inspired the respect of age, and Mrs. Wynneford, though advancing in years, was yet an enthusiast. When domestic misfortunes drove the first to the seclusion of a residence in Switzerland, the friendship of the last determined her to follow. The heart of the major, though more placid, was not less affectionate. The arrangements of his affairs were speedily executed, <FIDambig><Exclamation>and the first letter of Mrs. Mellrose they answered in person!</Exclamation></FIDambig>

It is vain to describe the influence of this conduct. If friendship can closely link at home, it can much more closely link in a foreign country. Mrs. Mellrose felt it as a sacrifice to herself, and repaid, it with all her gratitude. Little Julia was in continual delight; -— Mr. Mellrose <FIDitalics>"<i>wondered what brought them!</i>"</FIDitalics>

But suppose we forget him, at least as long as he will permit us. Let us speak of Mrs. Mellrose.

<Description>The cottage of Mrs. Mellrose almost hung over the Lake of Geneva, and, excepting, on the south side, was surrounded by boldly rising steeps. The white chimney betrayed it to the crews of the passing boats: – they approached nearer and beheld it embosomed by the luxuriant branches of the lime, the poplar, and the accacia, and the walls covered with vines. It appeared the abode of taste, peace, and cheerfulness: —- it bespoke the truth.

The residence of the major was separated from that of his friends by the projection, on the point of which the maniac had taken his nocturnal station. To facilitate the friendly intercourse, a passage had been made beneath this projection. Even this passage overhung the waters, but it was secured from danger by a rustic railing, and the western termination presented a view of the major's house. -— The borders of the green bank on which it was seated were washed by the waters of the lake, and though not so exalted as the dwelling of Mrs. Mellrose, it was more open, as the major laughingly observed -- more grand --------- It looked to belong to a richer inhabitant —- this also was the truth.</Description>

Thus settled together, the intimacy of the families cannot he doubted. It was friendship in its kindest and most friendly forms. Mr. Mellrose had engagements suited to his mind; his wife and daughter were therefore at liberty to pursue theirs, and it was soon established between them and their friendly neighbours that every alternate evening was to be passed at THE HERMITAGE on the rocks; or THE RETREAT on the grass plat.

The very day the major took possession of this RETREAT, his son completed his twelfth year; Julia had not yet attained her eighth. Henry, in right of seniority, deemed himself entitled to direct the sports, but Julia, by the natural right of her sex, seemed to think herself equally entitled. Frequent quarrels ensued, but the end of these quarrels was to make up again, and it generally appeared that Julia was the conqueror. <SceneQuasi><Trigger>One day</Trigger> Henry had prevailed on his father to charge a pocket pistol. In the moment he was going to fire it off, Julia ran across, and he was terrified lest the wadding should have reached her. She however saw no cause for alarm, and would in her turn fire it off. The contest was eager on both sides, till Henry, in vexation, threw the weapon to the ground, exclaiming, <DiaQ>"Pshaw, you little romp, take it and be killed if you chuse."</DiaQ> She snatched it up laughing, and clasping his neck with her little arms, cried, <DiaQ>"Dear, dear Henry, do let me!"</DiaQ> The boy was appeased — he whispered his father to charge it lightly; and when he fearfully placed it in her fearless hand, he earnestly cautioned her to keep it at a distance. Julia was delighted with hie indulgence, and he was pleased to see he had made her so happy.</SceneQuasi>

In the mean time they grew in years, in stature, and in mental improvement. Henry received his education at the college of Lausanne, assisted by his father at home. Julia's growing perfections were cherished by the cares of her mother. The parents of Henry watched the expanding character of Julia, and the mother of Julia earnestly endeavoured to unfold the probable character of Henry. They could not be indifferent to what concerned them so nearly, for it is scarcely necessary to announce that the children were intended for each other. At the age of seventeen Henry was sent to prosecute a tour through the Italian and German states. Julia, then only thirteen, wept for his departure, but the same evening she laughed at the gravity of his father, and mother, and played a thousand antic tricks to dissipate the remembrance of their loss.

In truth, not even the dawning of a passion was yet perceptible in either. —- Henry was already an enthusiast in female beauty, and Julia was not beautiful. Her complexion was brown; and her nose, instead of being acquiline, might almost be termed short: <FIDambig><Exclamation>besides, she was a romp, and nothing could be more horrible in girl!</Exclamation></FIDambig> Julia, on her part, thought Henry consequential and unreasonable. He told her it was indelicate for a girl to swing so high, and seriously advised her to have the cord between the great Wallnut tree taken down without delay -— Then he was eternally reading poetry, and she could endure nothing but prose. In a word, her patience was often terribly exhausted.

When he was actually gone, she however found she could not so well spare him. The boat on the lake was now useless. Nobody would row while she held the rudder. Her rambles to a distance were forbidden, for she would not be permitted to go alone. The fruits on the tops of the trees were untouched, since she had nobody to climb the branches. She could not see the necessity of sending him away; and when his letters related the wonders he was daily viewing, she could not discover the reason why they might not all have gone with him.

But time reconciled her to the privations his absence imposed; and as her mother judged this to be the period to forward the final formation of her character, her manners, and her person, she was more strictly confined to the study of the necessary pursuits. Her improvement in each became daily more visible: her character strengthened, her manners refined, and her person was hourly adorned by new and varied graces. The parents of Henry indulged their anticipated triumph in witnessing his astonishment at an alteration so great and so unexpected; they even imagined what he would say, and made a thousand very sagacious arrangements —- in perspective.

But Henry's thoughts were not as their thoughts. He had formed new friendships, new connectons, new wishes. It was perfectly natural he should do so, for he possessed an independant fortune, a yet more independant spirit, and was universally admired for his mental and external attainments. His mother's letters had unwittingly betrayed her hopes for the future, and as the period of his expected return approached, these wishes became more anxiously expressed. This was however wholly subversive of his own designs, and in a circumstance of life so important, his father had always and repeatedly assured him he should not be controuled. In a word, the letter that was to have announced his return, announced — <Exclamation>his marriage!</Exclamation>

<Exclamation>Had a flash of lightning dried up the lake, the good old couple could not have been more astonished!</Exclamation> <Exclamation>They stood immoveable!</Exclamation> <FIDambig><Exclamation>It was the first calamity that had ever descended on their heads, and it was inflicted by their son!</FIDambig></Exclamation>

Yet nothing could be more distant from the thoughts of Henry. He had mixed with the world, and in the opinion of the world had made an unexceptionable choice. He even expected the congratulations of his parents on hearing he had married the concentrated perfections of nobility, wealth, beauty and accomplishments. He described his choice all that a lover can believe, a husband hope, and a parent can require. He was raised to splendor and felicity, and was indebted for these blessings to the young and lovely Lady Maria Allington.

The confusion this intelligence created was unspeakable, and it was long before the tumult subsided even so far as to render the disappointed major, and his yet more disappointed wife in any degree accessible to the voice of reason. The good sense of Mrs. Mellrose at length prevailed, and their letter of reply expressed their wishes that their son might be happy. Their wishes were indeed sincere: but they felt that his interests were now much separated from theirs, and looked to the future in which he was concerned as little more than a blank.

By this event the return of Henry was protracted. He was detained at Berlin by some affairs respecting his wife's fortune, a very large portion of which had been left her by a relation who had at an early period of life quitted his country and connections in a fit of disgust, and entered on a military career under the auspices of the immortal Frederick. Age however compelled him to retire from the field. Inactivity brought on ennui, and ennui was followed by bad health. His reflections returned to England — He had heard that his orphan niece, Lady Maria, was the pride of England, and became suddenly anxious to see her. She immediately obeyed his summons, and arrived time enough to receive his last breath and to take possession of the entire of his large fortune. The will which bequeathed her this established her sole and independant mistress, and this right she determined to preserve inviolable; but Henry Wynneford soon became the nominal sovereign, and in the character of her husband was invested with the privilege of holding the agency of her affairs.

The intelligence he transmitted to his parents was an apology for his delayed visit to them; but their anxiety to see him had been already damped: their hearts were void and spiritless within them — yet Julia hovered near; —- unconscious of her power, she saw its effects, and pleasure at her success gave her new powers of pleasing. To them she was still as a daughter, as such she became established in their affections, and she alone was permitted to seduce them from their afflictions.

As time, however, passed, the remembrance of their absent son became more impressive, and their impatience to see him revived. He had been separated from them almost five years. They wrote to him their wishes. His reply announced to them that he was on the eve of being a father, and that the moment his wife and infant could travel in safety, he would eagerly hasten to present them.

Such was the situation of affairs, when the unfortunate maniac became an inmate of the major's house.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. IV.</ChapMarker>

The period of his illness excited the greatest anxiety and hope, but hope continually became stronger. <SceneQuasi>At the expiration of a fortnight he asked <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"where he was?"</ReportedSpeechQuotes> The kind major was near to inform him; he betrayed great agitation, but the soothings of humanity calmed his spirit -- tears burst from his eyes. <DiaM>"Thank God!" <M>he exclaimed</M>, "they are the first I have shed for twenty years!"</DiaM>"

<DiaM>"Indulge them, my good sir," <M>said the major, drawing the curtains</M>; "we are all human -— you shall be alone for half an hour."</DiaM>

At the expiration of that time, Mrs. Wynneford entered the apartment with a cup of chicken broth. He was unable to speak, but gratefully took what she offered, and sinking on his pillow, dropped asleep.</SceneQuasi> In some hours he awoke, and the physician pronounced his recovery. In a few days he was able to sit up, and in the course of the second fortnight to leave his apartment.

It sometimes happens that similar duties of humanity require to be performed in different ways. Had a peasant wanted the care and hospitality of Major and Mrs. Wynneford, he would have received it as certainly as this unhappy claimant in their house; but in the present instance, many feelings were called on in conjunction with their compassion. Circumstances led them to suppose this foreigner a gentleman. His incoherent address to his friend had first betrayed this, and now his conversation daily confirmed it; it was therefore to be supposed that his sensations were proportionally refined, and it was certain they were more than commonly acute. The major and his wife thought it yet time enough to enquire whether he deserved his misfortune -— they treated him as if he did not.

During his confinement to his chamber, the long established rules of the double family had not been infringed; but now, that he was to make one of the party, his introduction must be managed with some degree of caution. He was yet too much an invalid to bear conversation at home, or to walk abroad; it was therefore determined that their evening visits should for a short time be suspended.

Though he rapidly recovered his health, he betrayed frequent symptoms of a still disturbed state of mind. A continual terror seemed to haunt him, and a knock at the door nearly rendered him insensible. His friends perceived this, and gave him their strongest assurances that not even their dearest neighbours should intrude on him without his permission; and this assurance evidently contributed to his composure.

<SceneDia><DiaM>"I have been a most unhappy man," <M>said he, <Trigger>one day</Trigger>.</M> — "I am a native of England, and a noble of Prussia. My fortunes, my rank, and I hope I may add my character, give me an eminent station in the circles of society. My conscience is free from the stains of disgrace, yet I have here <M>(pressing his heart)</M> a fearful remembrance of anguish!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No inhabitant of this world is exempt from evil," <M>observed the major</M>.</DiaM>

The baron shook his head, and for a moment concealed his face. <DiaM>"Except yourself, major," <M>said he, with quickness</M>.</DiaM>

The major in his turn shook his head dissentingly; and willing to win the baron's confidence, he gave him his own. He briefly related so much of his disappointment, as to explain that his son had not married to his wishes.

<DiaM>"My dear sir," <M>with much energy exclaimed the baron</M>, "if your son loves his wife, you have nothing to regret."</DiaM>

<Dia>"True —- on his account I hope not; but his mother and myself had indulged a thousand hopes: we looked to see him in domestic life, and even to partake it with him. I know he has deceived himself. At the age of little more than twenty he might have done so, but I also knew his nature. He now floats in the current of ambition; but when the fleeting shadow of visionary enjoyment shall pass away, what will be left to supply its place? apathy for himself, and apprehension for his children. He will then regret that he has been dazzled by a false glare -— he will wish, too late, that he had united his youthful imagination to his parents' experience, and selected the wife of his judgment as well as of his passion."</Dia>

The baron started from the sopha, and walked to the window.

<DiaM>"Besides," <M>pursued the major, occupied by his subject,</M> "he will, I hope, live to be old himself; he may then feel that something is due to a parent's old age. Not only he himself is cut off from us, but his children must of necessity be alienated. Our old-fashioned ideas, the foolish fondness of a grandmother's cares, and a grandfather's prognostications, are not admissible in the nurseries of the great. His own fortune, independant of any addition I can make, was sufficient for not only the comforts but the elegancies of life. He will one day find that the wealth of empires cannot fill up the vacuum which sickens the heart in the absence of domestic affections."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No! -— Oh, no!" <M>said the baron, in a suffocated voice.</M></DiaM> The major beheld him sink on a chair, his eyes fixed and glazed, and his colour ghastly pale. He called for assistance, and the unhappy man was soon restored; but the cause of his misfortune was now guessed at.</SceneDia> That was sufficient to secure him from a repetition of any circumstances that could again recall the remembrance.

It must be owned it was not wonderful they had never guessed at it before; for no man was less forward to remind them of the word LOVE than this baron. His figure was uncommonly tall, and so thin as to present no bad emblem of a cloathed skeleton. His head was enveloped in a black velvet cap; a black patch crossed from the middle of his forehead to below the left temple; his right cheek was contracted by a large scar; his nose, once broken, had been ill put together again; and his shoulders stooped almost to a bow. Besides all this, he was at least forty years old.

<Reader>Would you not</Reader>, after this description, pronounce the baron an hideous fright? and if <AuthorI>I was describing him for ever, I could not paint him otherwise</AuthorI>; yet the impression he made was not that of ugliness. His eyes were large and expressive; his teeth were very fine; and his air, notwithstanding his stoop, was graceful and military. The major, among other conjectures, had supposed him an officer of the most elevated rank.

<SceneDia>The following morning, for the first time, he joined them at the breakfast table. They observed with pleasure he looked in better health.

<DiaM>"Yes," <M>he replied</M>, "in better health of mind, I have spent the night in reflection, and summoning all my best powers of resolution. Gratitude to my benefactors has stimulated me to this exertion. You have already sacrificed your comforts and pleasures to my benefit, but I cannot longer impose on you this restraint — My good friends," <M>he added, with a melancholy smile</M>, "if I find I do I must leave you."</DiaM>

Mrs. Wynneford warmly insisted that he should not.

<DiaM>"Then you shall retain me, madam, if you please," <M>he replied</M>: "return to your usual habits of life; if I can join you, it will do me good; when I cannot my chamber shalt be my refuge."</DiaM>

The major could readily believe that the society of a pious clergyman and two charming females must do any man good; he therefore agreed to indulge the baron's wishes.

The creeking of the wicket-gate, which terminated the passage under the projecting rock, interrupted their conversation. <ArrivalDeparture>It was opened by Julia</ArrivalDeparture>, who leisurely advanced across the grass-plat with, a small basket in her hand.

<DiaM>"She is in a sober mood this morning," <M>said Mrs. Wynneford, in a tone of satisfaction</M>; "but indeed she has been so since the baron's illness."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have not heard her even sing since," <M>rejoined the major</M>. "Suppose we begin our reformation by introducing her?"</DiaM>

The last sentence was addressed to the baron, who, to the speaker's astonishment, appeared in violent agitation. Mrs. Wynneford instantly left the room to prevent the entrance of Julia; but the unhappy man made an effort to conquer himself, and vehemently insisted on her return with her young friend. The major feared to resist, and in a few minutes called them in.

They immediately appeared. Julia bowed slightly to the baron, and passed to the window, where the major stood. Mrs. Wynneford, however, approached him with the basket in her hand; and removing the top leaves, shewed him it was full of fine purple grapes. <DiaM>"They are the first Mrs. Mellrose has gathered this year," <M>said she</M>, "and she has sent them to you."</DiaM>

The sudden anguish of frenzy gleamed in his eyes; he raised them to her's with a piercing expression. Again they descended to the basket, which, snatching to his bosom, he burst into tears.

<MonologueThought>"Unhappy man!" <M>thought the compassionate Mrs. Wynneford</M>, "how unaccustomed must he have been to kindness when such an instance as this can overwhelm him!"</MonologueThought> She, however, took no notice of his emotion, and crossed the room to her husband and Julia, who were turned towards the window and talking in a half voice.

Soon after, supposing the baron recovered, she ventured to look at him, and perceived his eyes rivetted on the figure of her young friend: the next moment Julia said she must return home, and again slightly bowing to the baron, left the room with Mrs. Wynneford.

<DiaM>"How do you like my rustic?" <M>asked the major, still standing to look at her through the window as she re-passed to the wicket</M>; "do you think her handsome?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Not —- as I expected."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Own to me," <M>rejoined the major</M>, "that you are disappointed; in a place like this you expected to see nothing less than a divinity?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"My —- my mind was prepared —"</Dia>

<Dia>"I can readily believe it; but Julia did not once address you, nor did you even see her speak to me -—"</Dia>

While he spoke he still continued to look through the window at his young favourite, who left the house, and was re-crossing the green to the wicket: but turning, she perceived him, and kissed her hand. <DiaM>"God of mercy!" <M>exclaimed the baron; and starting from his seat, he hurried out of the room.</M></DiaM></SceneDia>

<SceneQuasi>They did not again see him till dinner, when he reappeared with resumed composure. He held a letter in his hand, which he entrusted to the major's care, to forward as directed for his banker in London. During the repast he was often abstracted: but evidently anxious to recover himself, frequently started into conversation. His friends, with much delicacy, aided his exertion; and his spirits gaining strength and confidence became more equal.</SceneQuasi> In the evening the venerable Curé called to make his enquiries, and was detained; nor did the convalescent, during the course of it, again, betray any emotion.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. V.</ChapMarker>

<ScenePerception>The next morning, when Julia called to pay her accustomed visit, she was accompanied by her mother. As they crossed the green they saw the baron standing in the window of his chamber; from which, however, he suddenly retreated as they more nearly approached the house. Their visit was a long one, yet he did not appear; and concluding he did not wish to do so he was not disturbed by any message: but Mrs. Mellrose left a request with her friends that he should accompany them in the evening on their family visit to the Hermitage. When at dinner the major told him of this his reply was, <CharacterDiction>"certainly;"</CharacterDiction> but soon after, when they were setting out, he pleaded a letter of consequence to write, and promised he would follow. They disputed not his humour, and left him.</ScenePerception>

Julia had prepared a very light cake; and for supper she knew that fruit and sallad were more proper for an invalid than curds and cream. But the cake the baron did not appear to taste, and she began to fear that her precaution respecting supper would be equally unpropitious. This, however, did not happen. <SceneAction>When the sun had sunk his beams below the lake, and given place to a less splendid light, his figure was distinguished in the path winding under the rock. Julia descended to meet him. He stopped, and leaned against an olive tree, as if waiting her approach.

<DiaM>"You are fatigued," <M>said she</M>, "and you cannot be otherwise, the weather has been so sultry; but the alcove is quite cool and refreshing. Come —-" <M>and she offered, her arm to assist him,</M> "you will soon be rested there."</DiaM>

His attitude, while she spoke, resembled a statue. He stood intently gazing at her; but the singularity of this circumstance passed unobserved: A large English spaniel had fawned on the object of it, who was engaged in repulsing the animal till he fled back as if to shew them the way. <DiaM>"You cannot well see the steps," <M>said Julia, again offering her arm</M>, "but they are not steep."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Will you be my guide?" <M>he faulteringly asked.</M></DiaM>

Julia, in a voice of gaiety, answered she would.

<DiaM>"Then <i>I will follow!</i>" <M>he rejoined, in a low agitated voice.</M></DiaM> A little surprised, she lightly ascended the steep. He eagerly pursued; and was greeted by his expecting friends with a warm and sincere welcome.</SceneAction>

Thus was a stranger, wretched, mad, and a wanderer, saved from death, and restored to sense and to health by the interference of a charitable hand. It was easy to see he was deeply affected by his preservation, and blessed the authors of it; but he needed not: they found more than enough to repay them in witnessing his recovery.

The progress of daily incidents now gradually returned to their natural order. The baron recovered his health, and Julia was determined he should recover his spirits. She exerted every variety of her powers to draw him from the melancholy and abstraction he yet frequently betrayed; and the success of her efforts was, at least, periodically evident. During the early hours of the morning, before she was expected to the RETREAT, he was restless and anxious; and when she appeared at the wicket he hurried to meet her with undisguised eagerness. In the evening his manner changed; he was gloomy; spoke seldom; and generally contrived to remain strolling on the borders of the lake till the falling night drove him to join the social groupe; where, though surrounded by cheerfulness, not even the wiles of Julia could draw him from his invariable and ill-timed reserve.

This method in his madness at length not only created surprise but alarm. The major observed that the unfortunate baron saw or heard nobody but Julia in the morning; but neither saw nor heard her in the evening. This brought forward the recollection that in the mornings she was always unaccompanied by her mother, but in the evenings her mother was always present. A suspicion of sinister designs suddenly started on his mind, and he resolved to watch the stranger with steady end penetrating eyes.

<SceneDia>But these reflections were <Trigger>soon</Trigger> absorbed in much more interesting concerns. Julia had prepared the usual refreshments, which were that evening to be partaken at the Hermitage. The Curé was already arrived, and had been talking to her mother an hour at least. Yet nobody else appeared. Surprised at the delay she descended the steep, and proceeded to make personal enquiries.

Her light footsteps soon passed to the wicket, when the cause of her surprise was instantly explained. A post equipage, with outriders, announced that the long promised visit of Henry Wynneford had now taken place.

A sudden recollection that this was no time to intrude, prevented her indulging an instantaneous and energetic wish to meet her early friend; she was about to return to proclaim the event to her mother when she perceived the Baron issue from the house. He bounded towards her with a swiftness that astonished, till she plainly distinguished his features were agitated even to fury. Her first thought was to escape; but almost before she could turn he had reached her, and rudely seized her hand.

<DiaCutaway>"For Heaven's sake," <M>she demanded</M>, "what is the matter?"

<Cutaway>He gnashed his teeth, and his eyes wildly rolled.</Cutaway>

"Baron," <M>said Julia, with firmness,</M> "what is the cause of this strange behaviour?"</DiaCutaway>

<DiaM>"You shall learn," <M>he replied</M>, "the evidence of my perdition! How could I keep my senses and behold the sight I have now beheld? —- Can you wonder I curse my existence? —- Wherever I turn I see every human being happy but myself!"</DiaM>

<Dia>"I beseech you, Baron, be calm!"</Dia>

<Dia>"Let me first blot from my memory what I, too, might have been. Was it for this I hurried across the continent of Europe? only to gaze at the blessings I have so madly abandoned!"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Really, Baron," <M>said Julia, in much displeasure,</M> "I cannot understand, nor will I be made subject to this caprice!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ha!" <M>he exclaimed, fixing his eyes on her in amazement</M>; "that voice -— that air —- they met my senses long, long ago!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Baron, Baron!" <M>cried Julia,</M> "awake I beseech you from this delirium!"</DiaM>

He clasped his hands above his head in all the frenzy of his late disorder, and rushing headlong from beside her, was quickly out of sight.</SceneDia>

Her terror was now unspeakable. Her harshness had been assumed from the observations she had made, that the unfortunate lunatic was timid of offending her; and the temper of mind into which he relapsed at the moment, compelled her to the necessity of bringing him to subjection. But she now suffered inexpressible alarm in apprehensions for his safety. She flew back to the Hermitage; and her mother, prompt and resolute, sent messengers different ways to make enquiries.

<SceneQuasi><Exclamation>Alas!</Exclamation> this suspence, though painful, was rendered infinitely more painful by the return of their enquirers, who, with pale affright, brought the intelligence that their master was almost killed. <FIDquotes>"The mad gentleman had met him at the hamlet, and beat him almost to death."</FIDquotes> The astonishment of Mrs. Mellrose and her daughter, in the first moment, precluded all other sensations, till the sound of voices at the foot of the rock excited them to alarm, and they beheld Mr. Mellrose carried up the steps by four men. He appeared quite insensible. His conveyance into the house and to bed was the work of a minute; and in half an hour the surgeon was with him from Lausanne.</SceneQuasi>

<SceneQuasi><Exclamation>How different was the scene acting in the dwelling of Major Wynneford!</Exclamation> -- The worthy old pair —- they knelt, and wept, and prayed. In truth, it was some time before they recovered the use of their sober senses -— and then at the sight of their grandaughter, they almost lost them again. They alternately pressed her to their breast and gave her from the arms of one to the other, as if she was their own exclusive property; then again they embraced their son, and gave their ardent assurances to their daughter that <FID>she was very, very welcome!</FID></SceneQuasi>

It may easily be imagined that the present scene obliterated every other idea; but the gradual progression of occurrences recalled to the memory of Mrs. Wynneford a multitude of very important arrangements, and these soon puzzled her seriously. Here was her son and daughter, and nurse and child, and lady's maid and gentleman's gentleman, with along retinue, all to be accommodated. The necessity of dislodging the unfortunate Baron was absolute; yet she felt severely mortified at being compelled to an apparent unkindness, and the major confessed he knew not how to turn the poor wanderer out. -— Happily, however, they remembered the little blue chamber at the Hermitage, and which Julia had once actually designed for the maniac; and the major resolved to go himself, and settle the affair with Mrs. Mellrose. <SceneAction>He called for his hat and stick, and his son learning whither he was going, gladly availed himself of the accelerated opportunity to see Mrs. Mellrose, and his little friend Julia.

What a crowd of recollections rushed on Henry's mind as they crossed the green to the wicket, and passed under the rock. Quickly they reached the foot of the steps, where they found young Gaspard holding the bridle of a horse.

<DiaM>"Hey dey!" <M>exclaimed the major</M>, "have they got a visitor <i>here</i> to?"</DiaM>

Gaspard replied it was the doctor who had not yet left his master.

<<DiaM>"The doctor!" <M>repeated both gentlemen, in a surprise that gave little Gaspard the opportunity to relate the tale of wonder.</M></DiaM> <FIDambig>He had been sent out just in time to witness the affray</FIDambig>, and related that <CharacterDiction>he saw the mad gentleman spring upon his master, who was walking quietly along, and only just looking at him -— that he (the Baron) did not speak one word, but foamed at the mouth, and made a furious blow at Mr. Mellrose, who fell to the ground -— <FID>and then the Baron fell on him and beat him dreadfully -— and the people were afraid to go between them, because ten chances to one he might do them a mischief</FID> -— so at last he was tired, and springing up, ran away into the mill.</CharacterDiction>

The astonishment excited by this narrative had not time to subside before the descent of the doctor confirmed it. He declared Mr. Mellrose in a very dangerous situation; and suggested the necessity that the person who had reduced him to such a state should be properly secured, adding, that the moment he reached Lausanne he would apply to the magistracy respecting him. The major could only assent, and the doctor departed.</SceneAction>

The purpose for which the major came was now changed -— <SceneQuasi>he pursued his way to make new enquiries, and offer consolation, and was followed by his son; the latter however was left in the parlour, while the former was admitted into the sick room, from whence he returned in half an hour in great agitation. <FID>He had never witnessed such a scene.</FID> Mr. Mellrose had recovered his senses; and with the most intemperate bitterness, accused his wife and daughter of being the accomplices of the Baron to insult him. In a rage, he forbad them to leave his sight, and vehemently declared that any one who presumed to interfere between him and his family should be made to repent it severely. The major saw the danger of provoking him by opposition, and therefore deemed it most prudent to keep silence. He accordingly left the house, and, accompanied by his son, resolved to investigate the business still further, by seeing what was become of the miserable maniac.</SceneQuasi>

<SceneDia>He therefore turned from the path they had passed, and on reaching the hamlet, a light in the lower window of the mill proclaimed them admittance.

They gently knocked, and the door was opened by the miller himself. The terror of the poor man's countenance gave way to joy on seeing who had knocked; but instead of speaking he made a sign of silence, and beckoning them into a back room, guardedly shut the doors.

<DiaM>"Messieurs," <M>said he</M>, "cannot be surprised. I never was afraid in my life before, but a madman is not a common man."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What! Ambrose!" <M>exclaimed the major</M>, "have you too been beaten?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"No, Monsieur -— but we were obliged to avoid it by doing as we were ordered. —- My lord the Baron, as if he had been master of imposts, ordered Marguérite to prepare his apartment."</Dia>

<DiaM>"There was no harm in that," observed the major.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Excepting, Monsieur, that we wished to keep the apartment for our children to sleep in. Marguérite ventured to tell him so, but she might as well have gone to blows with the mill-wheel. He rolled his eyes. In fact the poor woman was frightened, and had only to do as he commanded."</Dia>

<DiaM>"And did that appease him?" <M>asked Henry.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Monsieur, yes: all of a sudden my lord became as quiet as I am now; and when the people who had followed him from the scuffle made a noise about the house, he was not a whit moved by it –- he said they were blockheads, and that he had only done what he ought to do: so as Monsieur Mellrose is not <i>tout a fait admirable</i>, we thought there might have been some old grudge between them. -— They best know that understand."</Dia>

This sagacious observation was interrupted by a slight noise at the door which stunned the miller like a stroke of electricity; and it was slowly and widely opened by <ArrivalDeparture>the subject of the preceding conversation</ArrivalDeparture>. He stood for a moment contemplating the group as if he had never seen them before, and then with an air of contempt, composedly asked them <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"What they wanted?"</ReportedSpeechQuotes>

<DiaM>"Is this address to me, Baron?" <M>demanded the major, with some resentment</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Yes, to all spies who come to make secret enquiries."</Dia>

<Dia>"It was to spare you, Baron."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I don't chose to be spared," he interrupted.</DiaM>

Henry had been observing him earnestly while he spoke -— <DiaM>"Certainly," <M>said he</M>, "I have seen you before."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And I have seen you, sir," <M>he replied</M>, "what then?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Baron," <M>resumed the major, in a tone of pacification,</M> "I have respected your misfortunes, but it was because I believed them the result of a dreadful calamity, not of wilful error."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Then you thought wrong."</Dia>

<Dia>"I now begin to discover I did. The outrage of this day's conduct -—"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Stop!" <M>cried the Baron, advancing closely to his opponent</M>; "say not a word to censure that deed. It was the most meritorious of my life!"</DiaM>

<Dia>"You are aware then of what you have done?"</Dia>

<Dia>"—- Of what I wished to do. Is the miscreant dead?"</Dia>

<Dia>"What do you mean?"</Dia>

The Baron advanced his head as if to whisper a reply; but suddenly burst into a convulsive laugh. His wildness instantly returned in full force: he looked around him in terror, and shrinking from his companions with characteristic caution till he got clear out of the room, <ArrivalDeparture>he sprang up the stairs and flung to the door of his apartment.</ArrivalDeparture>

The major saw with deep regret that nothing to relieve the wretched man was in his power. The hour was advancing, and from what the doctor had said it might now be conjectured that the offender would not be left unmolested. He therefore judged it expedient to warn the miller of the juridical visit he might expect; and having done so, and offered his kind interference in any thing that could be useful, he departed from the mill, and with his son took the way to their peaceful abode.</SceneDia>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. VI.</ChapMarker>

Montesquieu has written most charmingly on the subject of beauty. His Essay on Taste is an admirable performance, and <AuthorI>I</AuthorI> advise every person of feeling to read it. It will explain many sensations of which we are sensible, but which are seldom examined. Had Major and Mrs. Wynneford perused it with attention, it would have saved them much consequent vexation.

<Exclamation>Poor beauty!</Exclamation> — The learned President sinks her terribly from her elevation: but he is obliged to admit, that <Sententia>when she first appears she is irresistible</Sententia>. When the major and his yet more prejudiced wife beheld Lady Maria, they accorded their son a willing pardon. <Exclamation><FIDambig>She was perfectly beautiful!</FIDambig></Exclamation> She had been so from the hour of her birth, and custom had rendered it familiar to her. She concealed her vanity, and received homage with that air of the world which is very becoming. Add to this, she was mentally adorned in an equally singular degree; her education had almost commenced with her beauty. She had an Italian governess and a French maid. Every master that could contribute to increase the power of her attractions was procured with the most scrupulous attention; and the talents and beauties thus nourished in infancy at home had been finally perfected by an early residence in foreign courts.

A meteor so blazing must strike with astonishment. Lady Maria very naturally exulted in the evidence of those impressions which she never failed to produce; and Major and Mrs. Wynneford, at once compelled to abandon a prejudice originating in their own disappointment, were doubly eager to repair an injustice of which they felt themselves fully conscious. They now involuntarily bowed to the shrine from which they had so impiously turned. Lady Maria was pleased with her success, and resolved to pursue it. —- She resolved to convince them she was as amiable as she was lovely.

The morning after her arrival therefore, when the miller came to inform the major of the truth of his suspicions respecting the magistrate's visit, she took the most earnest interest in the unfortunate Laron's affairs. She deplored with all her might the necessity that he should be confined till the danger which threatened the life of Mr. Mellrose should be over or confirmed; but as sincerely rejoiced that so much mercy had been shewn him as to award him the treatment due to a nobleman. -— She indeed felt it a little vexatious that the Major and Mrs. Wynneford did not admire her humanity; but they had tacitly passed an eulogium on it she was not aware of. They deemed it perfectly natural, and neither felt nor expressed any surprise that she should feel as other people felt.

Neither did Henry express any surprise. The reason was just — he had often seen her duplicity, though her sentiments of compassion had hitherto escaped his observation. But ever anxious to preserve for her the eminence he proudly saw she had obtained, he watched every look, and seized every opportunity to prevent her receding in the progress she had made. — This was indeed an attention altogether necessary. Lady Maria had been accustomed to a life of eternal variety, and the scenes of his father's house were unvaried. Even the little society expected was dispersed by the accident which detained Mrs. Mellrose and Julia in attendance on a husband and a father; and the only resource that remained against ENNUI was the temporary relief of exploring the face of the neighbouring country, and visiting its most interesting curiosities.

When therefore Henry saw the approach of the soporific demon, he proposed an excursion by water to Geneva, to which Lady Maria most eagerly acceded. Mrs. Wynneford promoted it with equal eagerness, though from a different motive. She had been so accustomed to a secluded manner of life, that the bustle of enlarging the circle had already fatigued her; besides she pined to see her friends at the Hermitage, from whom she had been separated already two whole days. Lady Maria, though beautiful, she could not help thinking of as a stranger, and a stranger must be entertained. This task had already wearied her, and she was happy to transfer it to her husband and Henry. <SceneQuasi>On the third morning they accordingly embarked, and she saw them push from the shore for their destination.

The good old lady now breathed freely. She felt herself at liberty, and instantly set about using it to the best advantage. She would indeed have rejoiced to make her little grandaughter the companion of her visit, but the nurse was infinitely a finer lady than the grandmother, and chilled and offended, she avoided a contest in which she by no means felt secure of a victory. The baby she knew would be properly attended, and dismissing from her mind all care and anxiety, she set out alone.

Julia was crossing from her father's room to the parlour when the well-known short cough struck her ear. She sprang to thy door, and welcomed her kind visitor in her arms. Mrs. Wynneford as eagerly and warmly saluted her young favourite and Mrs. Mellrose, who immediately joined them, and felt that even the silence and melancholy of this house was to her wearied spirits refreshment and repose. The condescension, the studied suavity, of Lady Maria, were forgotten in the sincere and overflowing affections of Julia and her mother; and in the course of a few hours, she at least twenty times repeated her regret that she could not stay and assist in the cares about a man whom she despised and disliked, but who she deemed entitled to her good offices for the sake of those who were bound to him. — <DiaM>"If Lady Maria," <M>said she</M>, "was like one of ourselves, I could leave her at home in my place;" <M>and looking at Julia, who sat beside her, she kissed her cheek.</M></DiaM>

The hours of this morning flew; Mrs. Wynneford thought them cruelly short, and felt no little chagrin, when accidentally looking through the parlour window, the white sails of the boat caught her eyes, and compelled her to remember she must return. It was in truth with an heavy heart she took leave.</SceneQuasi>

On rejoining her own family group, she found it increased by a very agreeable addition. <ChPortrait><ChNameIntro>Sir William Hartly</ChNameIntro>, a distant relation and particular friend of Henry's, had met them in their rambles, and readily accepted their invitation to join them on their return. No man possessed the <i>je ne sçai quoi</i> in a greater degree than Sir William. His good temper and good sense rendered him a most admirable companion; and even in his giddiest moments he betrayed a feeling heart, and a considerable share of integrity. He laughed at and ridiculed the follies of the day, yet confessed he spent every day in their pursuit. <SpeechInsert>"I can adore virtue," <M>said he</M>, "but I should die of ennui if I practised it!"</SpeechInsert> His manners and appearance were suited to this declaration: he was free, voluble, and quite at ease; yet he contrived to be respectful, entertaining, and even modest. Had he gone one degree further, he had been forward, fatiguing, and even impertinent. His features, though delicate, were manly; his address gentle, though decisive; and his figure and attitudes called to mind the graceful gestures of a <i>Vestris</i>. Had he been a little taller, he had more nearly approached the sublime.</ChPortrait>

<SceneDia><DiaM>"After all," <M>said he, in the evening, when he saw the major nursing the little Cecilia</M>, "there is certainly nothing I long for so much as to be grandfather; but, heaven forbid, I should ever have a wife and children!"</DiaM>

They rallied his system, which however he defended with great gravity.

<DiaM>"Pardon me," <M>said he</M>; "I pique myself upon the good sense of this position. The major dandles this bantling with all possible serenity, for his cares are over -— his day of danger is at an end; it is satisfaction only that remains. I shall be mightily rejoiced if heaven send me similar felicity at the same period of life; but I am not presumptuous enough to undertake the progressive measures of so heavy a charge —- I dare not run my neck into a noose which might choak me with vexation -— for assuredly though there are thousands of amiable girls, there is a disastrous scarcity of good wives!"</DiaM>

Lady Maria exclaimed against him as a vile slanderer.

<DiaM>"Not at all," he replied -— "if I was a a slanderer I would boldly tell you that you, and some of your hundred acquaintance, are excellent wives, and most delectable mothers."</DiaM>

<Dia>"How would that be a slander?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Inasmuch as your ideas and mine of these characters are widely different. —- For instance, would you not be enraged if I were to assert that your pleasures are dependant on your husband, and that your cares and anxieties are inseparable from your duties? You would never forgive me for thus grossly depreciating your merits. Yet so entirely different are my opinions on this subject, that I swear to you nothing could be to me a greater misfortune than such a wife as yourself."</Dia>

<DiaM>"That is envy!" <M>cried Henry, endeavouring to blunt the arrow that grazed his feelings</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Be it so," <M>he replied</M>, "and I shall be glad to have it thought so, because I intend to cicisbeo Lady Maria when we arrive in England. I am just suited to such an office; for at any time she does not chuse to exhibit me, she can easily accommodate me under the seat of her carriage, to be drawn forth when convenient.

I'll dwindle to a little dog, and crouch beneath her feet;
In coach or chariot, boat or barge, or any thing that's meet:
I'll change me to an insect small, or elf of nimble wiles.
So I obtain the gracious boon to revel (<i>sometimes</i>) in her smiles!"</DiaM>

This impromptu, pronounced in heroics, produced a laugh, and a laugh produced good humour. The excursion of this morning had so well answered their expectation, that another was proposed for the next; and before Sir William left them to return to his auberge, he found himself a week deep in engagements.</SceneDia>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. VII.</ChapMarker>

To a man such as Sir William appeared, this circumstance might be deemed desirable, but to a man such as Sir William really was, it was the contrary. It was a state of confinement that fettered even his imagination; and it was certainly the very reverse of his intentions. He was an enthusiast in fancy —- in feeling almost beyond enthusiasm. His design in visiting the Pays du Vaud could not be accommodated to the leaden usages of a regularly assembled party. In a word, he came to depend for his pleasures on himself.

<SceneAction><Monologue>"To go again on the lake," <M>said he, as he stepped on a craggy eminence to contemplate the silvery light undulating on the serene expanse</M>, "to sit fool in the middle for the companionship of a woman of ton, a man of fashion, an antiquated soldier, and a thrifty dame! What sin have I committed that must be atoned for by such a mental flagellation!"</Monologue>

While he spoke, he fortunately recollected he was now alone; and pronouncing a very devout address to the gracions Goddess of Liberty, he resolved to abandon himself to the felicity she for the present benignly granted him.

<RhetoricalQ><Reader>Reader</Reader>, have you ever visited this charming country?</RhetoricalQ> It is the birth place of <AuthorI>my ancestors</AuthorI> — this can only impress myself; <Exclamation>but it is also the scene of a romance striking, eloquent, and seductive! Sir William had also found it dangerous!</Exclamation> 'Twas true, his understanding was awake to the necessity of certain restrictions in moral society, and deemed the man a profligate who argued for their subversion: but to read a mere recital was neither to argue, to practise, or to justify its moral defects; and he read it repeatedly, and with new pleasure

<Monologue>"It must be owned," <M>said he</M>, "there is something of St. Prieux in my composition. Those vivid sensations, those glowing delights, those unsubjugated fancies, are all features of myself. If I found an Eloisa who could bewitch my senses, I should make no scruple to abandon myself to her control. This would be to prosecute my rambles in the happiest state of perfection!"</Monologue>

Musingly he walked forward. His imagination took the reins and drove him at headlong speed. He almost fancied himself in search of the object with whom, to realize the picture. His steps wandered by the lake, whose ripling waters, curling in the moon's beams, soothed his senses to tranquillity. A distant clock at length sounded on his ear, and he returned to seek the path from which he now discovered he had strayed.

To recover it was not however so easy. He missed his way through the windings of the rocks, and finding himself more deeply involved in the labyrinth of an unbeaten track, he endeavoured to descry a human habitation from which he could enquire his way. Even this was difficult; till happening to range round the foot of a barren hill, he accidentally discovered a dim light. On approaching he found it proceeded from a solitary hovel, and hastening towards it, he smartly knocked at the door.

<DiaM>"Fanchon," <M>said a voice of impatience within, and immediately the door was opened</M> —- "Fanchon, why did you stay so long?"</DiaM>

Sir William was struck with the tone and form of the speaker, and stood in silent surprise: but alarm and disappointment at discovering her mistake conspired to overcome the poor creature, who staggered against the rough wall for support. Compassion urged Sir William to her assistance. What was his amazement when his eyes met the terrified features of a very beautiful girl!

<DiaM>"I —- I thought," <M>said she</M>, "it had been Fanchon."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Pardon me," he replied —- "You have no cause for terror. You will oblige by informing me if I can render you a service?"</DiaM>

<DiaCutaway>"Ah! you cannot! -— My mother is already dead."

<Cutaway>Sir William started</Cutaway> —

"Just gone!"</DiaCutaway> — His eyes were directed by those of the fair speaker to the corner of the room, where, on a little straw, lay a figure who, from the attitude of the head and arms, appeared to have just expired. He approached more nearly, and was struck with horror to behold the eyes staring, the features distorted, and every symptom of agony and famine.

<DiaM>"I am frightened!" <M>said the girl, in a hurried manner</M> — "her shrieks were so dreadful! — and Fanchon stays away — it is quite cruel."</DiaM>

<Dia>"And did she leave you alone with this object?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Yes, many hours ago. She went to bring Father Peter, and has not yet come back."</Dia>

<Dia>"And have you had no help?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"No, none — and my mother's cries and groans frightened me so, that I would have gone myself to seek for somebody; but she held me so fast — she has almost crushed my hand."

<M>She held it forward to Sir William, who was shocked to see strong marks of her assertion.</M>

"My poor unhappy mother!" <M>said the girl, losing her terror in grief</M> — "My unfortunate mother!" <M>and her tears flowed</M>.</DiaM>

A heart the most cold and unfeeling could not have remained unmoved. Sir William's was composed of very different materials — he was deeply affected. The beauty of the girl, the simplicity of her manners; the evidence of her forlorn state, were claims on his humanity which he admitted without a question. He at once determined to protect her innocence, and relieve her sorrows; yet he knew not how to devise the immediate remedy. From herself alone he could learn the means: and he earnestly entreated her to be composed and assured, and to assist him with her advice of what could be done.

She however was incapable of giving him any — <FIDquotes>"she knew nobody — she had lived a year in that cottage, but her mother never suffered her to go out. Fanchon was a poor orphan, quite foolish, who was accustomed to go to and from the town to make the neccessary purchases."</FIDquotes>

<FIDquotes>"Was there no cottage near? no house where assistance could be procured?"</FIDquotes>

<FIDquotes>"No, except the Hermitage wham Miss Julia lived."</FIDquotes>

Sir William almost exclaimed aloud; his imagination had not yet returned into the sober path, and his romantic visions again rose in review.

<Dia>"Julia! And where does she live?"</Dia>

<Dia>"At the Hermitage — but I dare not go there — my mother would never suffer me."</Dia>

<Dia>"Never! what was the cause?"</Dia>

<Dia>"She once said she hated Mrs. Mellrose; but she hated so many people — Fauchon always prays for her and Miss Julia. She had a fever once, and they sent her medicines, and a nurse. I wanted my mother to let me ask the same for her, as Fanchon said I might, but she was very angry — so the poor girl was frightened."</Dia>

<Dia>"Then your mother wanted medicines and a nurse?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Every thing."</Dia>

<Dia>"Gracious God! — But now that your mother is no more, you may perhaps hope for assistance on your own account?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Oh no, no, no!" <M>cried the girl in terror</M>. "My mother I — do you know — my mother left me her curse if I should do so: she even said she would appear to me after she died."</DiaM>

The astonishment of Sir William was now augmented by curiosity. He would have asked questions to satisfy it, but the circumstances which surrounded him called for more immediate attention. He had not time for mature deliberation — prompt and decisive measures were absolutely necessary, and he resolved instantly to pursue those which appeared most essential.

The first was to find some person to take charge of the body, and perform for it the funeral rites. But when he spoke of leaving the house for this purpose, the poor girl appeared in such unfeigned terror, that he proposed to her to take her with him, and to this, with mingled eagerness and reluctance, she assented.

The next question was, whither to go? He was a stranger to the country — his companion equally so, and neither of them knew even whereabouts they were: but concluding they must soon find a beaten track, they sallied forth to seek it, and the girl recollecting in which direction Fanchon always came and went away, she conducted him into a path from which they soon gained a more open road.

<DiaM>"Now," <M>said the girl, joyfully,</M> "if we could but meet Fanchon and Father Peter ----"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Who is Father Peter?"</Dia>

<Dia>"He was my mother's confessor — he came to see her once."</Dia>

<Dia>"Only once?"</Dia>

<Dia>"No more — then they had a violent quarrel, and he threatened to excommunicate her but they made it up — I don't know how — though she desired him never to come again."</Dia>

<MonologueThought>"Humph!" <M>thought Sir William</M>, "she seems to have been a woman of spirit.</MonologueThought> <DiaM>And where," <M>he demanded</M>, "does Father Peter live?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Near the town; but I don't know what town."</Dia>

Sir William now saw that he must take upon himself the entire conduct of this affair; and conjecturing that Father Peter was probably well known, though not a member of the established church, he determined to knock at the first habitation, and make his enquiries. His intention was however rendered unnecessary by <ArrivalDeparture>the appearance of a figure</ArrivalDeparture>, whose colossal stature was sufficiently evident, even in the shades of night, and whom the girl instantly declared to be Father Peter himself. As he approached, with long and hasty strides, she eagerly met him, and was instantly recognized.

<DiaM>"Hah! my daughter Rosalia!" <M>said he, in an accent of surprise — but he looked askance at her attendant</M>.</DiaM> When she apprized him of the event which had already taken place, his surprise was lost in consternation; and he sharply censured her for permitting her mother to leave this world without the assistance of the church. Rosalia was too much shocked to offer any explanation or defence; but Sir William readily undertook both, aid in a tone which soon brought the father to reason. He professed himself rejoiced that his dear daughter was not to blame; and even offered her an asylum in his sisters house, till a future residence should be assigned her. The propriety of the proposal was obvious, and it was instantly accepted.

<DiaM>"Then I will return," <M>said the father,</M> "and recommend my daughter to Rebecca's good care. Her house is not far distant."</DiaM>

Sir William thought he perceived an inclination in the worthy confessor to exclude him any share in the girl's protection; and he instantly resolved to take more than his share. He would not be prevented from conducting her himself to the house, and seeing to whom he must for the present consign her. The father did not remonstrate; but with sullen strides turned, and preceded them in their way.

<Blend>On knocking at the door</Blend> of the habitation, dignified by the title of house, it was opened by a ragged peasant girl. Her mistress, she said, was in bed; but the loud voice of the father soon brought her down stairs. Sir William was not surprized that poor Rosalia shrunk at the sight of her female guardian, a stiff hard-featured Amazon of fifty-five, who received the charge with a very bad grace, and gave some broad hints that the church was better able to provide for one of its orphan children than they.

<DiaM>"My good lady," <M>replied Sir William</M>, "I do not mean that either the church or you shall be called upon on this occasion. Your protection for the present is all that is asked. If you will for a time accord an asylum to the living, and Father Peter will make the necessary arrangements for the dead, I shall reserve to myself the satisfaction of defraying the attendant expences."</DiaM>

The upright virgin observed that Monsieur had reason, but he was a stranger — <FIDquotes>"Not that she had any doubt of his charitable intentions."</FIDquotes>

Sir William, much disgusted, drew out his purse, demanded of the father what sum he expected, and, without cavil, paid down the money. During the short transaction, the eyes of Rosalia were intently fixed on him, then suddenly clasping her hands, she exclaimed with fervor, <DiaQ>"God! God bless him!"</DiaQ> and burst into a passion of tears.

A croud of sensations assailed him. He had been struck with her beauty and her distress, but had inadvertently supposed her a fool. She had betrayed superstition, and even stupidity; and the trouble he found himself involved in, had reduced the lively emotions of compassion into the heavy performance of a necessity. This little action again recalled all his interest; he <i>liberally</i> recommended her to the kindness of her temporary guardians, and promising herself to see her early the following morning, <Blend>he departed,</Blend> followed by her blessings and her tears.

<FID><Exclamation>What an adventure!</Exclamation></FID> In every light he viewed it his curiosity increased. The dreadful appearance of the features of the deceased, and the peculiarities in her disposition, betrayed by the daughter, excited strong suspicions of her character; and these suspicions were further increased by retracing the behaviour of Rosalia. Though surrounded by extreme poverty, she was not only beautiful in feature and in figure, but possessed a certain air of polish, altogether inconsistent with vulgar life. Add to this, he now called to mind that her language corresponded with her manner. She spoke the most correct French, and her expressions, though simple, were well turned and refined. He had been astonished at her indifference to her mother's death; but her behaviour to him was a proof that this indifference did not originate from the absence of feeling, and was apparently more than justified by the conduct and character of the deceased herself, who seemed to have existed in a state of warfare with all the human race, and hated with such bitter vengeance individual subjects of her abhorrence.

But who these were was another matter of wonder — <FIDquotes><Exclamation>"Mrs. Mellrose!"</Exclamation></FIDquotes> the name was English! and <FIDquotes><Exclamation>"Julia!"</Exclamation></FIDquotes> He had been wishing for exactly such a discovery. By making enquiries it seemed highly probable he could find out her abode, and finally he went to sleep, fully determined to find Julia herself.</SceneAction>
