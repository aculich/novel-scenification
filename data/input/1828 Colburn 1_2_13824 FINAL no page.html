<ChapEpigraph>All hands unmoor! proclaims a boisterous cry,
All hands unmoor! the cavern'd rocks reply:
Roused from repose, aloft the sailors swarm,
And with their levers soon the windlass arm.
The order given, up springing with a bound,
They fix the bars and heave the windlass round,
At every turn the clanging pauls resound:
Up-torn reluctant from its oozy cave,
The ponderous anchor rises o'er the wave.
Falconer's Shipwreck.</ChapEpigraph>

<SceneOther><DiaM>"Come, ladies," <M>said <ChNameIntro>Colonel Howard</ChNameIntro>, as he entered the dining-room of the Star Hotel at Portsmouth,</M> "Blue Peter is flying, and the wind is fair; so, instead of visiting Haslar Barracks this morning, we must repair on board the good ship Cumberland; there is not a moment to lose, the pursers are arrived with the last dispatches from the India House, and the foresails are loose, so let us beat a quick march and be gone. The pilot is ready to take us on board, and here are the men for the baggage."</DiaM> This intimation was addressed to his two nieces, <ChNameIntro>Charlotte</ChNameIntro> and <ChNameIntro>Elizabeth Percy</ChNameIntro>, and their companions, <ChNameIntro>Miss Hume</ChNameIntro> and <ChNameIntro>Miss Panton</ChNameIntro>, children of old friends of the Colonel, who were returning (in company of his nieces, and under his care) to their relatives in Bengal. The young ladies looked surprised at receiving the intelligence they had expected every day during the last fortnight; and now seemed, almost for the first time, to feel that they were really leaving England; but there was no time for reflection; the boatman loudly called for the luggage, and each hastily retired to put up the few things which had been kept at hand for daily use. Mrs. Morris, the servant who attended the ladies, had, upon the first intimation of sailing, gone to take leave of her family in the town, and returned so bewildered by sorrow, that her services were of very little use, a circumstance fortunate for those who were benefited by the exertion her inability forced them to make.

<Blend>In the pilot-boat</Blend> they found several other passengers for the Cumberland; some silent and melancholy, brooding over the last farewell of aged parents and dear relatives; others, from whose minds those feelings had quickly faded, animated and loquacious, in the buoyancy of youthful expectation; Cadets already talking of their promotion, and young Writers of their excellent interest. Colonel Howard sighed as be listened to the multitude of expectations which could never be realized, and mentally praised the divine goodness which gilds every scene to the youthful mind, and disposes it to think lightly of the troubles and toils of the road. <SententiaCharacter>If it were possible that youth could possess the knowledge which experience affords, probably less would be achieved, because less would be undertaken.</SententiaCharacter>

The day was fine, and the scene interesting to those who had spirits to enjoy it. As is usual in times of war, a frigate was appointed to convoy the fleet until they should have passed the latitudes where they might expect to fall in with cruisers of the enemy. She rode at single anchor, ready to weigh and put to sea, while the fleet, consisting of four regular Indiamen, six extra ships, and fifteen merchant vessels of different burthens, were busily employed receiving their passengers on board, and making the requisite preparations to stand out to sea. When <AuthorWe>our pilot</AuthorWe> ran his vessel alongside the Cumberland, the gentlemen, with the help of a rope, scrambled up the steps on the ship's side, and were on deck in an instant; a chair was lowered for the ladies, formed like a barrel with an opening in front, a comfortable seat, and a flag to wrap round them and <FIDquotes>"make all snug."</FIDquotes> In it the ladies were successively placed, while <ChNameIntro>Captain Kentledge,</ChNameIntro> commander of the Cumberland, stood at the gangway ready to receive them, superintending the operation, and calling to his men to <FIDquotes>"haul taught and hoist away handsomely."</FIDquotes> Ten minutes placed them all safely on the quarter-deck, where Captain Kentledge welcomed them on board, and introduced his officers with suitable form due to the station of each. A party of the Company's recruits were trudging merrily round upon the capstan bars, weighing up the anchor, to the tune of, "The girl I left behind me," played by the ship's band, to invigorate their spirits during their laborious work.

Dinner was announced in the cuddy, and the whole party sat down to a long table, where little was eaten, and less spoken by any, except the Captain, who bid them <FIDquotes>"be of good heart;"</FIDquotes> and, as soon as the cloth was removed, called upon all to fill their glasses, and pledge him in his toast, <FIDambig>"Health to Old England, and when we lose sight of her may we see no land until we spy the flag-staff in Madras roads."</FIDambig> Presently the hoisting of sails, and increasing motion, began to testify that the ship was under weigh, and with a leading wind commenced

<QuotedLit>"To walk the waters like a thing of life."</QuotedLit>

<Blend>The cuddy party soon dispersed.</Blend> Those whose friends had accompanied them on board retreated to their own cabins to give and receive a long adieu; while the youngsters, who had formed an everlasting friendship during three days' chance residence together at a Portsmouth hotel, retired to their own half of the great cabin, there to amuse themselves, while they could hold up their heads, with criticising those who were to be their shipmates for the next four or five months. The whole fleet was now under weigh, and the last boats for the shore were leaving the ship; friends followed friends to the gangway, exchanging mutual blessings, with tearful eyes and aching hearts, unwilling to pronounce the final <i>farewell</i>, or resign the hand which they grasped, in most cases, <Exclamation>for the last time!</Exclamation> <Exclamation>How merciful is the dispensation which draws an impenetrable veil over futurity, and prevents the earnest gaze of anxious inquiry from discovering the long array of suffering which it conceals!</Exclamation> <Exclamation>Could we perceive the untimely bier on which our brightest hopes are perhaps to be laid, or the wasted forms, and changed hearts, of those who stand before us in the pride of youth and glow of warm affection, how would the withering view appal us!</Exclamation> <Sententia>But Hope, our guiding star, shines brightest in the darkest hour, and peoples the gloom with fairy forms of its own creation; like a beacon to the storm-tossed mariner, it speaks of rest and joy after the bitter present shall have passed, and while the parting voice still lingers in our ear, cheers us through the long perspective of coming years, with the prospect of the returning smile.</Sententia>

As the motion increased, the fresh-water sailors retreated, one after another, to their respective cots, sick, cold, and low-spirited; while those who had passed their probation walked the deck enjoying the fresh breeze, and marking the successive objects as they lessened and disappeared from their eyes. The fleet continued to bowl down Channel, but the ladies could hardly raise their heads to write a few hurried lines to their friends on shore by the pilot, who was just leaving them; nor could Colonel Howard's voice at their cabin door, calling upon them to get up, and take farewell of the white cliffs of Britain, bring them upon deck. Assisted by Mrs. Morris, who had often made the voyage before, Miss Percy got out of bed and reeled to the stern gallery, where, raising herself upon a locker, she strained her sight to discover the chalky cliffs from the white clouds over them; but the dancing motion of the vessel, and the swell of the waves, confused all to her aching gaze, and, sick at heart, she hastened to lay her throbbing head down upon her pillow. <Sententia>The commencement of a long voyage is a state of misery which no one who has not experienced it can truly imagine. In short trips the certainty that it will soon be over, is a point to which the mind can turn with hope; here that comfort is denied; the oppressive feeling of having recently, and perhaps for ever, parted with all we are accustomed to love; the entering upon a new state of existence under the most depressing of all bodily suffering; and the suggestions of an aching head, that the present evil state can only terminate with the voyage, are grievous aggravations of actual sufferings.</Sententia>

After having fairly cleared the Bay of Biscay (where the Atlantic, rolling in with unbroken violence, even without wind, always causes a heavy swell), the sufferers, one by one, began to re-appear in the cuddy, and Captain Kentledge, as the speediest way of restoring them to perfect health, insisted upon the ladies taking chairs upon deck, and enjoying the fresh sea-breezes, which were now more temperately warm than when they
left England. An awning covered the quarterdeck, defending them from the sun; by degrees the extreme giddiness ceased, and they were all able to raise their eyes from the deck, and look steadily upon the clear, blue, brilliant waves, <Metaphor>sparkling like sapphires in the sun-beams</Metaphor>. The troops on board were paraded morning and evening, the old sails got up to be mended, the sailors at night, after their work was done, danced in the calm moonlight, the band played on deck, and every thing fell into the regular fine weather routine of a long voyage.

The first day on which all the party met at the cuddy table at dinner, each person's name was found in the place allotted for his, or her, occupation during the remainder of the voyage. The ladies were placed upon either hand of Captain Kentledge, diverging from the centre, so that he might see all that was doing on deck, and flanked on one side by Colonel Howard, and on the other by <ChNameIntro>Mr. Graham,</ChNameIntro> an old civil servant of the East India Company. The only ladies on board, besides those who have been already introduced to the <Reader>reader's</Reader> acquaintance, were the two <ChNameIntro>Miss Owens,</ChNameIntro> daughters of Major-General Owen, of the Bengal army, lady-like girls in manner and appearance; and, though not remarkably handsome, extremely fashionable. They had received what is called <DoxaQuotes>"the best education,"</DoxaQuotes> at the first school in London, and had been <DoxaQuotes>"brought out"</DoxaQuotes> twelve months before they left it, by their aunt, Lady Dashwood. The passengers were twenty-eight in number, including those we have mentioned, <ChNameIntro>Mr. Hamilton</ChNameIntro> of the civil service, returning to India after leaving his wife and children in England; <ChNameIntro>Mr. Sommerville,</ChNameIntro> also a civilian, who had been at home on private business; <ChNameIntro>Captains Bently,</ChNameIntro> <ChNameIntro>Cunningham,</ChNameIntro> and <ChNameIntro>Harrowby,</ChNameIntro> returning from furlough; and Lieutenants <ChNameIntro>West,</ChNameIntro> <ChNameIntro>Willoughby,</ChNameIntro> and <ChNameIntro>Brook,</ChNameIntro> who had visited Europe on sick certificate; with the usual proportion of young writers, cadets, and assistant-surgeons.</SceneOther>

<SceneDia><Trigger>After quitting</Trigger> the dinner table, Captain Bently and his friend Willoughby retired to the cabin of the former, where they were soon joined by West, who exclaimed as he entered, at the same time shutting the door, and throwing himself upon Bently's couch, <DiaQ>"I am the best natured fellow in the universe, and have the greatest talent at serving my friends in the most agreeable way."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Without going further, West," <M>interrupted Willoughby,</M> “let your friends know in what they are obliged to you, and I am sure they will save you the trouble of so much triumphant congratulation."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I knew," <M>rejoined West</M>, "how anxious you must all be to hear something of the charming addition we had to our dinner-party to-day; for though the names have been heard, the fair forms have not before been seen amongst us. Now for what I have learnt! The lively little girl with dark hair, rosy cheeks, and sparkling laughing eyes, seated upon the Captain's right, is Miss Panton, only daughter of old Panton of the civil service at Cawnpore. She has been brought up by her doating grandmother, who has indulged her in so many whims, that I fear I shall have great difficulty in keeping pace with them. The tall fair stately nymph by her, is Miss Hume, a Scotch girl, of ancient family, but little fortune; she has lately lost her father and mother, and is now going to her Aunt Mrs. Dundas. Dundas is an excellent fellow, and has, since I left the country, become one of the members of the medical board. I knew him very well when he was superintending-surgeon up the country."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But who," <M>said Willoughby,</M> "is the tall and elegant girl who sat at the further end by Colonel Howard? she realizes all that I can imagine of female loveliness; how beautifully the lustre of her large dark eyes is tempered by the fringe that shades them; what a witchery of youth, grace, and modesty there is in her whole appearance; the turn of her head and neck is a study for a sculptor."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Poor Willoughby," <M>cried West, shaking his head,</M> "his poetic flights betray him. Miss Percy's bright eyes have undone him; on me, bright eyes have only a cheering and revivifying effect; but they will reduce Willoughby to powder, or poetry, which is the same thing."</DiaM>

<DiaM>But you forget in the mean time, West," <M>said Captain Bently,</M> "that you have not told us who sat at the Captain's left."</DiaM>

<Dia>"That mirror of elegance and fashionable acquirement is Miss Isabella Owen."</Dia>

<Dia>"No! no! West, not Miss Owen, — the lady by her."</Dia>

<Dia>"That is her sister, the equally fashionable and equally acomplished Miss Caroline Owen."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Still you are wrong, West," <M>said Bently impatiently;</M> "who could overlook the gentle loveliness of the other, to think of any thing so artificial as they are?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Not you, I am sure my friend," <M>added West,</M> "and I was so convinced of it, that I resolved not to mention Elizabeth Percy, until I had brought you to ask a direct question."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But where," <M>rejoined Willoughby,</M> "have you picked up all your information?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Why, after you had all left the cuddy, I walked a few turns with the Captain upon deck, and extracted it from him. I asked him to present me to the ladies, but he declined, saying, he made it a rule never to introduce his passengers, but that Colonel Howard might do it, if he thought proper."</Dia></SceneDia>

<SceneDia><Trigger>While this conversation</Trigger> was passing in the great cabin, one, something similar, was going forward in the Round-house. Miss Panton turned to Miss Hume, and inquired, <DiaQ>"My dear Flora, did you learn the name of that tall and very officious person, who helped you so assiduously at table? With what a dulcet tone he asked you to take wine, and how complacently he showed his white teeth. Do you think they were really his own?"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Harriet! Harriet!" <M>said Miss Hume</M>, "the whole world is nothing to you, but as it affords subjects to laugh at; I have almost an inclination to punish your ill nature by not answering your question. I heard Captain Kentledge call him Somerville, and he told me that he is of the Bengal Civil service, and has been at home for his health."</DiaM>

<Dia>"O very well, Flora, I am much pleased to find, that if other people do not see so much as I do, they can at least hear as well. I was so provokingly situated between the Captain and Flora, that I could not speak to any one, and had nothing to do but look about me, when I dare do it with impunity, and I observed that handsome officer upon the opposite side of the table, whose name I think is Bendy — yes, Captain Bendy I am quite sure it is — gazing upon Elizabeth, so that he quite forgot his dinner, until his servant, who was more disengaged, motioned to take away his plate. I saw Colonel Howard watching us over his spectacles from the other end of the table, while the gentlemen on the other side were grumbling that they had not been presented to the Ladies. It would have been more pleasant for all parties, if the Captain had gone through the ceremony at once.</Dia>

<DiaM>"But before you blame the Captain," <M>said Miss Percy,</M> "you should recollect, that half the people at table were perfect strangers to him until they came on board, and it is probable that amongst so many, there are some who would not be desirable acquaintances."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Certainly," <M>rejoined Miss Owen,</M> "it would have been highly indecorous to introduce all the new caught savages to us, but Captain Kentledge might have named the presentable animals!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"He could not, I think," <M>replied Miss Percy,</M> "have drawn that nice line of distinction, without creating a civil war in his ship!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Deadly as the feuds of my highland and lowland countrymen, in days of yore," <M>added Miss Hume</M>; "of all epithets, unpresentable would be the most obnoxious."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And so, to preserve their tempers," <M>said Miss Panton,</M> "which will certainly never keep a whole voyage, we are to go on in this insipid hum-drum sort of way. A few seasonable disputes would be vinegar and cayenne to us: however, I do not despair. I delight in seeing people make themselves ridiculous;"</DiaM> and away she flew to the piano, to play over the last new set of quadrilles.

Colonel Howard tapped at the door, and broke up the conversation by asking the ladies to walk; a proposal which was gladly accepted. <Blend>They found Captain Kentledge</Blend> and <ChNameIntro>Dr. Pillet,</ChNameIntro> the ship's surgeon, in waiting for them; who, each taking two ladies under their charge, proceeded to pace the quarter deck, while the rest of the party ascended to the poop for the benefit of criticism. Miss Panton walked with Dr. Pillet, and discovered with great delight that he was an original upon whom she could exercise her wit.</SceneDia> His use, or abuse, of some words in the English language, betrayed that he was an American, and <FIDquotes>"he guessed"</FIDquotes> that he had not left his native land until he had arrived at what he called <FIDquotes>"years of discretion."</FIDquotes> His ideas of right and wrong upon all subjects were regulated by what was thought and <FIDquotes>"done in Philadelphia;"</FIDquotes> and though, after the fashion of his countrymen, he took the liberty of constructing a few new verbs for his own use, and <FIDquotes>"progressed"</FIDquotes> in his application of them, he restricted the speech of all his associates to the precise meaning as explained by Johnson, independently of the corruptions of fashion; and was just as tenacious in upholding his high authority, as he was of the judgment, in matters of taste, of <FIDambig>the good people in Philadelphia.</FIDambig> How he had got his diploma was a fact none could perfectly understand; at least it could never be ascertained that he had ever read any book from beginning to end but Johnson's Dictionary. If, however, his studies were not very various, they were unremitting; and every time he made his appearance, it was to astound the ears of his hearers with <QuotedLit>"words of learned length and thundering sound."</QuotedLit> His simplicity and credulity equalled his ignorance of all that had ever taken place out of his own beloved Philadelphia; and, as soon as it became generally known, afforded scope for all the young geniuses and idle wits on board. Captain Kentledge was an experienced sailor, who, during the five and twenty years he had been at sea, had acquired a knowledge of every battle, loss by fire, and shipwreck, which had occurred from the first voyage to India until the present time; he could point out on his charts all the rocks and shoals where missing ships have been supposed to have gone down. In all that related to his own profession his knowledge was clear and comprehensive, beyond which it only extended to the private biography of the numberless passengers with whom he had sailed. A considerable share of good sense and natural quickness enabled him to make very just observations, and to illustrate his characters with several lively anecdotes, which in the presence of ladies he seasoned with sea wit, just sufficient to make them piquant.

The Ladies occupied the two round-house cabins, and a communication was left between them through the stern gallery which served for their drawing room. They were provided with a piano-forte, music, abundance of books and drawing materials; so that to those who knew how to employ it, time passed quickly. The Miss Percys had been taught by their excellent mother, that time was one of the talents entrusted to their care, for which they would have to render a strict account. They felt, that cultivation of mind and talent, was as much a pleasure as a duty; and acted upon a well grounded systematic plan of religious, moral, and general instruction, varied by the practice of those accomplishments proper to their sex and situation in society. The Miss Owens, as has been already mentioned, had received a fashionable education; and the natural temper of each, uninfluenced by any higher motive, dictated the line of conduct they were to pursue. Isabella was an accomplished girl, in the general acceptation of the word; and knew well, that to keep the station she had acquired, much industry was necessary. She had been accustomed to command the admiration of her aunt's guests, and applause was necessary to her; therefore she cultivated music with unceasing industry, and consequently with great success. She was ambitious, and, on her first introduction to the gay world, had the good sense to perceive that the palm of beauty could never be hers; but she resolved to persevere in her desire of distinction, and carry off the palm in another line; a palm which few beauties, secure of conquest, will take the requisite trouble to dispute. Here she was successful, and had often the inexpressible satisfaction of drawing around her, by "the magic of sweet sounds," the votaries of other shrines. Caroline Owen was naturally indolent, and consequently, as her time was at her own disposal, she frittered it away in extending her sleep, meals, and dressing, to the greatest possible length; and as the weather became hot, lounging upon her couch, and wondering how the others could contrive to endure so much exertion. Harriet Panton was a spoiled child, lively, idle, and capricious; the amusement of the passing moment was her only object; she played, sung, and drew in mere volatility of spirit, as she did not otherwise know how to get over the long forenoon; her reading, if it deserved the name, was confined to the lightest books of amusement, and when Miss Hume and Miss Percy wished to direct her, she declared against going to school again, and said, she <FIDquotes>"hated teaching, for her governess's sake!"</FIDquotes> Flora Hume, to much sweetness of temper and a kind heart, added good sense and a mind highly cultivated; there was a natural rectitude and integrity in her way of thinking and feeling which showed itself in the carriage of her body; her gait was as upright as her intentions.

<Sententia>To make a long voyage endurable, some mental stores are requisite. <Metaphor>It is to the passengers like a hard winter to a hive of bees.</Metaphor> They are denied any mental aliment from without, and are forced to live upon the stock they have already laid up.</Sententia> To pass the time between the intervals of eating, reduces many to the most ingenious shifts; idleness assumes all disguises, and yet is ever the same; she changes her shape every moment, to the great annoyance of near neighbours, without being able to shake off her attendant weariness. In the Cumberland, however, that was not the case with all. Colonel Howard, who in the course of his long service had held several diplomatic situations, spent much of his time in his own cabin, arranging the information he had acquired, and adding to it from the stores of others.

Captain Bendy's love of his profession, and literary taste, furnished him with abundant means of occupation; and it was not without considerable anxiety, that he found the powers of mind, once so ardently devoted to these pursuits, becoming daily less interested in them, or indeed in any thing unconnected with Elizabeth Percy: her gentle sweetness realized his waking dreams, and he saw before him the creature he had imagined in his mind, but hardly hoped to find amongst the daughters of men. When at an out station in India, almost beyond the reach of European society, in the solitude of his own bungalow he had pictured the being he would wish to share it with him, his fancy traced something like her; or, after a long and harassing march in the hob-winds, when he sat lonely in his tent, his servants and cattle around him slumbering out the fervid hours of noon, disturbed by no sound but the turtle-dove, which coos the most plaintively during the hottest hours of the day—his mind still turned to the same subject; and he had meditated upon it so long, and so often, that he had sublimated the creature of his fancy far beyond the every day forms of this <DoxaQuotes>"working, waking world."</DoxaQuotes> When at the termination of the campaign he re-visited England, it was in the hope of meeting one who would endear and sweeten the remaining years of his service: but he had been hitherto disappointed; the match-making mothers, and establishment-seeking daughters, which it had been his lot to meet with, were very different from what he sought. His fortune was not great; his liberality of disposition had prevented his amassing money, even when he was in the receipt of considerable allowances. Upon his arrival in England he found his father harassed by a considerable mortgage upon his estate. Filial affection, and perhaps the disappointment of his cherished hope, induced him to clear his father from all embarrassments, by making over to him the whole of his little fortune, and returning to Bengal sooner than he intended. It was not without feelings of severe mortification he could think of asking Elizabeth Percy to share his narrowed fortune; and it was not without dread that he felt the possibility of Colonel Howard's refusing his request, even should he be fortunate enough to persuade her. He had in the beginning endeavoured to resist the temptation, by rather shunning than seeking acquaintance; but the task was a hard one; they met daily at the same table; many little circumstances occurred to excite a common interest, and his attentive ear and discerning eye could every day observe some new charm of character unfold itself, so that he soon ceased to struggle against the stream, and gave himself up to the overpowering influence of a deep and ardent passion.

West had laughed at the whims of the lively little Harriet, and humoured her caprices until he found no other occupation half so interesting. She saw with great pleasure the power she had acquired over him, and exerted it, for her own amusement, in the most tyrannical manner. <SceneQuasi>Miss Owen <Trigger>had been making</Trigger> some observation upon the oblation offered to her taste, by the great pains bestowed by her victim to make an agreeable appearance. <Dia>"How carefully his mustachios are arranged à-la-Cossack; I am not quite sure, Harriet, that they do not divide his heart with you."</Dia>

<DiaM>"We shall see that presently," <M>said Miss Panton.</M> "I do not permit my slaves to have any will independent of mine; and unless they are removed by to-morrow morning, I renounce him for ever."</DiaM></SceneQuasi>

In conformity with this exhibition of lawful rule, she took the first opportunity of insinuating to West the improvement which such an alteration would make in his appearance, so ingeniously did she manage her project, that when he appeared at breakfast next morning, it was without the obnoxious mustachios. <SceneQuasi>He no sooner presented himself, than Miss Panton threw a glance of triumph to Miss Owen, which spoke plainly <SpeechImagined>"you see my power!"</SpeechImagined> but when poor West, thinking his prompt obedience entitled him to more than usual consideration, seemed to claim her notice, she asked Miss Owen aloud, with the most provoking indifference, <FIDquotes>"if she did not think that Mr. West himself looked frightfully that morning?"</FIDquotes> and declared she could hardly recognize him.</SceneQuasi> No part of the transaction escaped the notice of those on board, and it opened such a fertile source of witticism that West became highly indignant, and in furtherance of his resolution to escape from bondage, actually went so far as, upon pretence of indisposition, to confine himself to his cabin for two or three days. When he again joined the party it was with the magnanimous intention of shewing himself free. <SceneQuasi>Miss Panton no sooner read the state of his mind, in his countenance, than she hasted to put this resolution to flight, by hoping, in the kindest manner, that he had quite recovered, and saying in her gentlest tone, <DiaQ>"we have all missed you so much;"</DiaQ> he bowed to the compliment, and looked at her with an expression of sorrowing incredulity, which she dispelled with one of her most gracious smiles, <Metaphor>like the morning sun scattering the cold damp fogs of night.</Metaphor></SceneQuasi>

This reconciliation gave pleasure to both. <SceneQuasi>During his absence she had discovered that there was no one else on board half so agreeable, and she entertained some apprehension that the joke had been carried too far — though when Miss Hume in the most friendly manner remonstrated with her upon the impropriety of her conduct, she strenuously persisted in averring her utter indifference to the result, and thought it very hard, in the dearth of amusement, to be blamed for availing herself of what chance threw in her way; and, <DiaM>"I am sure," <M>she added, turning to Miss Owen,</M> "that the temptation to lower his self-complacency was irresistible, when he seemed to expect that he had gained credit with me by his conformity to my opinion. I cannot bear that any one should entertain the idea of exacting favour from me as a right; and when I meet with any thing of the kind, I cannot help making people sensible that they must be thankful for it as a favour to be dispensed or withdrawn at pleasure. Reasonable conduct, my dear Flora, spoils men, and leads them always to expect it, which is more than I can bind myself to for any human being. Those who enter my service will never be fatigued with tiresome uniformity. Look at West; if I permitted him to retain the silly idea that he had earned my favour, it would never have given him the delight which this gracious act of condescension upon my part has done!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"These arguments are all very ingenious, Harriet," <M>replied Miss Hume</M>, "but though they may have great weight with your slaves, they can have none with your true friends. Believe me, my dear, you lower your own character by such unfeeling indulgence of capricious levity, which you ought rather to labour with all your powers of mind to eradicate."</DiaM>

<Dia>"And if I did eradicate it, Flora, tell me what would be left behind. I have not your talents, or your information, to render me agreeable, and I never can make up my mind to be overlooked!"</Dia>"

<Dia>"O how you abuse your natural candour, by using it as a license for your faults instead of amending them."</Dia>

<Dia>"My dear Flora, I never in my life could bear to mend any thing, and you must just be contented to love me in spite of my faults. If I were half as industrious as you are, perhaps I might, as Captain Kentledge would say, steer clear of them; as it is, I must have something to pass time; and though you, and a few others, may find that a very easy matter, half the good people in this ship are reduced to as great straights as myself."</Dia></SceneQuasi>

Which was indeed the case. Many had no sooner finished breakfast, aired themselves upon the poop, ascertained which way the wind blew, how the ship lay, what was the reckoning, and how many knots were on the log, than they began to wish for dinner; and before that delightful period could arrive, were obliged to throw themselves into their cots, and in sleep jump over the intolerable interval. No public Walks — no place of amusement — no news from without — and hardly space within to permit the activity of body, which sometimes goes far to conceal indolence of mind.

However, every contrivance was tried in succession that the nature of circumstances would admit. The ladies' cabin was chosen for the coffee-room, whence a newspaper was daily issued, containing an account of the incidents of that world in wooden walls; but after the most conspicuous characters had been anonymously described, the various flirtations remarked and commented upon, all forms of witticism expended in embellishing and announcing daily trifles, poets' corners filled up with songs, odes, and sonnets dedicated to all the female divinities of Olympus, who were supposed to have come in disguise on board the Cumberland, there was nothing more to be done; even boys wearied (if they were not forbidden to do it) of shooting at every stray bird which chance brought within their reach. And the rolls of black hair ribbon, providently provided for writers and cropt cadets, by those who undertake <DoxaQuote>"the elegant outfit of young gentlemen for India,"</DoxaQuote> were all soon run out in fishing for dolphins and sharks, too wary to be taken by such tackle, even before the Captain had countermanded the expenditure of salt beef and pork, on such unprofitable avocations. The caricaturists in turn tried their powers, and began by exciting some laughter, but ended by making much mischief and endless disputes. Those who made the slightest pretence to musical ability performed duets; oft times to the great annoyance of those who were so unfortunate as to be within hearing of their powerful efforts. The multitude of musicians was at first a grievance, but the very energy with which they performed, went far to cure the evil. The violin strings could not stand the climate, and as they were expended, and some of the flutes cracked, the number of performers was reduced, for the comfort of the hearers, to those who knew the use of the instruments they undertook to handle.

<SceneAction><DiaM>Ladies! ladies!" <M>said Dr. Pillet, tapping at the round-house door,</M> "will you step out and see the captive that has just been made, the most sanguinary of the squalus tribe?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"See what?" <M>asked Miss Panton, opening the door, and gazing with admiration on the Doctor's open mouth and eyes.</M> "O yes! by all means let us see what has astonished you so much;"</DiaM> and without waiting for an answer she sprang nimbly past him.

<DiaM>"Miss Owen," <M>again said the Doctor,</M> "will you venture forth to see this most sanguinary and voracious caitiff?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"O willingly, Doctor, but what kind of a caitiff am I to see? not I hope a Wild Indian from Philadelphia?"</Dia>

The Doctor, whose ambition it was not to speak very intelligibly, and who liked to leave something to the imagination of his hearers, took no notice of the interrogation, but repeated his invitation all round; and <Blend>led out the whole party</Blend> to see the dying struggles of an enormous shark, which had just been hooked, and was lashing his tail upon deck.

<DiaM>"A most dreadful captive indeed," <M>said Miss Panton, flying to meet them as they came out of the cuddy</M>, "and who is the hero who has brought him into ‘durance vile?' I guess that can be only yourself, Doctor; see, the very animal recognizes you, and with that lash of his tail is 'progressing' towards you."</DiaM>

The Doctor had unwarily advanced before them all, in his zeal to descant in the hearing of so many auditors; but daunted by the violent motion of the shark, who threw himself forward by a powerful exertion, he made a sudden bolt sideways, and, in his eagerness to escape Scylla, fell into Charybdis, and disappeared through the after hatchway; which most unfortunately happened to be open at the moment.

<DiaM>"Doctor! Doctor!" <M>screamed Miss Panton, as she saw his toes disappearing, for he had gone down head foremost</M>; "where are you going?"</DiaM> and she ran eagerly forward to see what had become of him. At first it was not very easy to discern that he had pitched into an open sack of flour, brought up for the baker's use, and sent up the contents in such clouds, that he was quite lost to sight. However, after a little struggling and sputtering, he was discovered ensconced between two sacks, rubbing his eyes, and endeavouring to clear his mouth from the dry flour with which it was crammed, for he had pitched in open mouthed, and head foremost, and was half suffocated with the dust he had raised around him.

<DiaM>"I am happy to see you again, Dr. Pillet, after such an exit," <M>said Miss Panton</M>; "I am charmed to find you are quits for a powdering. Really when I saw you take such a leap in the dark, I almost expected to see the shark after you. Now do, Flora, you, who are always good and obliging, call the Doctor's servant to brush him down; or stay, perhaps, Doctor, if you were to come on deck, and let the sailors throw two or three pails of salt water over you, it would do just as well, and be more cooling too." <Cutaway>He coloured with vexation, as he observed the crowd of laughing faces collected round him.</Cutaway> "And I pray you be calm," <M>continued the tormentor</M>; "the frigidity of the bath will have much effect in allaying the irritation of the nervous system. Take time, Doctor, and clear your mouth before you begin to speak."</DiaM>

At length, after much sputtering, and shaking, and hemming, the crest-fallen Doctor rose from his recumbent posture; and not finding words weighty enough to vent his indignation, stalked off between decks in great wrath; while his little tormentor bent over the hatchway, and advised him <FIDquotes>"to keep his own counsel,"</FIDquotes> and promised that she would <FIDquotes>"never betray what had happened to the ladies in Philadelphia."</FIDquotes></SceneAction>

As they got into the warm latitudes, the steadiness of the trade winds, permitted them (while they were running a hundred and thirty or forty knots in twenty-four hours) to pursue their different avocations, as if they had been on terra firma, instead of Neptune's unstable dominions. <Description>Under the line, when the trade wind failed, the heat was intense. The sails flapped on the masts, for want of wind to fill them, and the fleet rolled in the swelling undulation, which accompanies a perfect calm; every rope and mast clearly reflected in the bosom of the heaving ocean.</Description> The ships refused to obey the rudder, and floated at random, the head of one and the stern of another often threatening, when within the sphere of each other's attraction, to run foul, to their mutual damage.

<Sententia>Nothing can exceed the splendor of the evening and morning appearance of the sun near the line; particularly at sun-set, when hasting to hide his head beneath the waves; a tram of clouds, radiant in purple and gold, seem to canopy his bed, and throw a brilliancy and pomp of colour around him, not to be witnessed in northern climes.</Sententia>

<SceneIterative>Many a calm moonlight night, when that lovely planet shed long lines of silver radiance over the summer-seas, and the shadows of small flitting clouds <Metaphor>fell like Islands on the main,</Metaphor> have <AuthorWe>our</AuthorWe> friends sat on the poop, and watched the stars coming forth in their beauty, or leaned over the gangways to mark the ship's course tracked in light through seas of liquid flame, scintillating like the stars in heaven. Then thoughts of distant England, and the land to which they were gliding arose within their mind. Colonel Howard watched the white foam as it came roaring round the bows, and mentally compared it to this world's society, turbulent, noisy, and evanescent; distant and scattered particles met by seeming accident; thrown together, they appeared to incorporate and become one mass; again an unlooked for swell disjointed them, and they parted, to sink in the ocean which gave them birth, or to run a separate course, and join no more.</SceneIterative> Bently looked to the conclusion of the voyage with mingled sentiments of hope and dread. He sometimes flattered himself that it might be but the beginning of brighter scenes for him; and again the bare possibility that it might for ever remove Elizabeth Percy from his sight, would intrude to torment him.

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER II.</ChapMarker>

<ChapEpigraph>––– So lovely seem'd
That landscape! and of pure, now purer air
Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires
Vernal delight, and joy, able to drive
All sadness, but despair: now gentle gales,
Fanning their odoriferous wings, dispense
Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole
Those balmy spoils.

When the fleet was within a few days' sail of the Cape of Good Hope, Captain Kentledge received a communication from their Commodore, ordering him to go in and take on board troops for Bengal, as one of the ships appointed for that purpose had an infectious fever on board, which would prevent the Committee of Health from permitting her to hold any intercourse with the shore. The season was too far advanced to admit of their anchoring in Table Bay, as it was the commencement of the Cape winter, that is to say, the beginning of May, when they had reason to expect tremendous weather on that exposed coast; they therefore resolved to make Simon's Bay, on the opposite side.

<SceneAction>A fine fresh breeze carried them into False Bay, and they shot rapidly past the majestic mass of rocky mountains which guards its entrance, amongst which "Hang-lip" stands conspicuous, <Metaphor>frowning over the scene</Metaphor>, and projected in bare and steep defiance into the sea. The sheer descent of these mountains into deep water renders the whole coast very formidable. For miles they extend like a bare and stony wall, barring all approach from the sea. The Cumberland was soon quietly brought to anchor in Simon's Bay, one of the many small creeks by which False Bay is indented, and which, from its sheltered situation, is a safe and commodious harbour at most seasons of the year. Simon's Town lay before them; its neat, clean, white-washed houses seeming to stand upon a long narrow shelf cut in the face of the mountains, and looking down upon its own little bay, defended on either hand by reefs of rock, upon which a formidable surf was breaking. A sunny morning brightly illumined the whole, and showed the rocky crevices which, at a distance, had appeared bare, clothed with gay vegetation, and flowers of every dye. <Exclamation>With what delight did <AuthorWe>our friends</AuthorWe>, after their long confinement, again feel the firm earth under their feet, and breathe the pure air of the mountains, sweet with the perfume of flowers!</Exclamation> The whole party walked up together to the principal inn, in its establishment a mixture of coffee-house, hotel, and boarding-house; in its architecture, like all houses at the Cape, a compound of Dutch, Anglo-Asiatic, and Chinese. Its fantastic green porch, and vine-covered trellis, give it decidedly the latter appearance. <AuthorWe>Our friends</AuthorWe> at once found, in setting foot in the house, that they were in a colony, and that a slave colony too, where the small quantity of agricultural produce, the frequent drought, and failure of harvest, with consequent dependence upon distant markets, render the common necessaries of life scarce and dear, at the same time that some of its luxuries are abundant. The rambling, unconnected, ill-appointed appearance of the house, prepared them for the entertainment they were to expect. Several clumsily cut joints of meat without bread, and abundance of wine and fruit, with a proportionate dearth of vegetables, were served up, with the hurried and confused attendance of poorly fed and worse clothed slaves. The reason assigned was, that ships never came into Simon's Bay but in bad weather; and that all the eggs, bread, and vegetables they consumed were brought over the mountains, so that they did not pay their carriage.

As soon as dinner was over, and the ladies could leave the table, the Miss Percys and Miss Hume prepared to enjoy a quiet stroll along the shore. Miss Owen and her sister, finding that they were too early to expect the attendance of the gentlemen, declined accompanying them on plea of fatigue, but proposed to follow when they should have refreshed themselves by a little rest. Miss Panton, to whom the prospect of amusement and idleness were more engaging than all the views in the world, declared her intention of remaining at home until she should have some inducement to go out. The evening was fine, and the ladies took the Block-house road, skirting the mountains, and leading round a projecting point which commanded a magnificent prospect of False Bay. <Trigger>They had not proceeded</Trigger> far before they were overtaken by Captain Bently, who, guessing their intention, and wishing to enjoy with them the fresh delights of an evening walk, had made his escape unperceived by the rest of the party. <DiaM>"I was certain, ladies," <M>he exclaimed,</M> "that you would not lose such a glorious sight as this sunset, and was eager to share it with you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Accustomed as I have been to picturesque effect in my own mountains," <M>said Miss Hume,</M> "the extent of the scene, the magnitude of the objects, and the purity of the atmosphere, exceed all I have ever fancied. Behind, what a lofty screen of rocky mountains, rich in vegetable wonders, rears its head to heaven! at our feet the wide extent of the noble bay, and beyond, the blue mountains of Hottentot Holland, in three distinct ranges!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"How the sun, as he descends, seems to accelerate his course," <M>added Bently;</M> "like a courser hasting to his goal—he has finished his race gloriously; what a flood of splendour he leaves behind him!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Look," <M>said Miss Percy,</M> "mark the changes which, while we are speaking, his setting produces upon the mountains! observe the clear ethereal blue of the near range, the brilliant purple of the second, and the faint rose of the distance, glowing in the latest beams of the splendid luminary which has just left us; and now the thin grey air-tint envelopes all, and blends into one mass the objects but this instant so fully relieved. Can any thing be more exquisite than the clear dark shadows which tremble on the deep waters of the bay?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nothing," <M>answered Elizabeth,</M> "nothing surely can be more lovely, Charlotte, except that moon rising over the rocky heights behind us, and tinging the whole scene with a softer, sweeter light."</DiaM> Bently stood beside her, contemplating her serenely beautiful countenance in the softened beam. A sigh escaped him. She felt that he was near her — and was happy. He saw her <QuotedLit>"heart lifted up to the giver of every good, and of every perfect gift,"</QuotedLit> and at that moment his feelings were identified with hers. They remained silent, unable to break a pause more expressive than words, — a deep and undefined delight held them mute. They were standing in the stillness of night, in a strange land, under the light of that calm moon which, since the creation of the world, has looked down upon the passing joys and griefs of mortality. Their hearts swelled with the feelings excited by the majesty of the scene around them, though they found no words to express them. At that instant Elizabeth's eye met Bently's, and he spoke to the glance. <<DiaM>"Yes, Elizabeth, yes; I would not barter the hope of being joined to you there," <M>and he pointed to the heaven above his head,</M> "for all that this world has to bestow, though valueless indeed would it be without you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Elizabeth! Elizabeth!" <M>cried Flora;</M> "come and help me to get up this beautiful geranium, which I shall try to take to India with me."</DiaM> Elizabeth and Bently went to her assistance, and succeeded in getting up the plant she wanted.

The feeling of perfect happiness, which seldom visits our earth, and when it does is nearly allied to tears, had spread its sweet and soothing influence over the minds of Bently and Elizabeth. They found they had a bond of union, bright above the world, of which its frowns could not deprive them, and this glance into the recesses of each other's heart, like a well spring, poured out delight within them. In their new-found confidence they felt as if they had been for ever friends, as if they had been born for each other, and as if nothing on earth could prevent it. Enviable state of mind, too bright and too pure to remain long in a world over full of sorrow.

They retraced their steps along the shelving shore, stopping to mark the old wreck of a large vessel fast wedged between the long reef called the Roman Reef, terminated by a bulky mass, which, from its shape, has acquired the name of "Noah's ark." — The sound of laughter, and various little coquettish exclamations about the roughness of the way, and the pain of walking over sharp rocks and broken shells, announced the approach of Miss Panton, and the whole party, even before her little form danced out from behind a rock, <Metaphor>like a sea-nymph sporting in the moonbeams.</Metaphor> In scrambling for a nautilus shell, which caught her giddy attention, she slipped her foot between two huge sea weeds, or rather sea trees (so great was their size) which the violence of the waves had torn from their oozy bed, and remained unable to extricate herself, calling to Mr. West, <DiaQ>“Do come and free me from this thraldom — I am unable to move!"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"If West were a wise man," <M>said Captain Kentledge,</M> “and regarded his own liberty, he would not give you freedom, Miss Panton." <DescriptorQ>And he spoke aside,</DescriptorQ> "If he does not alter his tack, and keep a good look out, he will be amongst breakers, before he knows what he is doing."</DiaM> — West was in the mean time, with the assistance of Dr. Pillet, actively employed in disengaging his busy little tormentor from the mass of wet and slippery weeds in which she had involved herself. She begged the Doctor to recover all the shells which she had scattered in jumping between the huge trunks, instead of on them, as she aimed to do. The poor Doctor, in his earnest efforts to be useful, tore her dress, and looked aghast at the mischief he had occasioned. He could not, though he strove hard to recollect every word in Johnson's Dictionary, find one at that moment fit to deprecate the anger he anticipated; and open mouthed, with hanging arms, and spread fingers, waited to hear her opinion of his delinquency. His attitude did more for him than words could — after a laugh at his expence, in which it was impossible for the rest not to bear a part, she dismissed him, saying, <DiaQ>"I guess, Doctor, that if you were not more <i>judgmatical</i> (to use a perspicuous phrase, which you have taught me) in your services to the American ladies, you could not <i>progress</i> much in their favour."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Yes, I could, and I did," <M>returned the Eighty offended Doctor</M>; "the ladies of Philadelphia are not so ungrateful and <i>disremembering</i> as you."</DiaM> <Dia>"Ah, Doctor! Doctor! how can you accuse me of being disremembering? have I not just given you a specimen of how much I remember of your Anglo-American improvements on plain English?"</Dia></SceneAction>

The next day but one was fixed for their departure for Cape Town, where they could have much better accommodation than their present quarters afforded. In the mean time they determined upon taking the morrow to see a waterfall at no great distance from the place where they then were, curious from its situation, and the deep caverns which, a little above it, extended into the mountain. At that season of the year the weather was so charmingly cool, that it was possible to walk out at all hours of the day. <SceneAction>They therefore set off early, and pursued a different direction to that which they had followed the evening before. Their path led them by rough and broken steps, along the side of a stream, which swiftly rushing through the valley sped onward to lose itself in the sea. Its steep banks, adorned with the gay variety of flowers which nature, with unsparing hand, has lavished over mountain and over heath. The hills around Simon's Town seem composed of rock bedded in sand. The sand is so light and fine, that, but for the infinite variety of trailing plants (particularly the Hottentot Fig) which cover its surface and bind its particles together, its vicinity would in windy weather be as terrible as the deserts of Arabia. The whole is one waste of flowers and flowering shrubs; bulbs innumerable find root in the sand; the mountains are covered with sweet smelling geraniums. The luxuriantly flowering scarlet geranium, which grows to a great height, is commonly used for hedging such little spots of garden ground as industry has been able to clip from the mountains. After walking half a mile, they found the valley, or rather ravine, in which they were, become so narrow, as only to leave room for the stream between its opposing banks. The footpath they were to follow crossed over the stream, and wound by a broken and slippery ascent up the face of the opposite mountain, which soon became so rugged that it was not without considerable difficulty they proceeded. Captain Kentledge, who undertook to pilot them, called to Willoughby, <FIDquotes>“to bear a hand, and take Miss Owen in tow, as she had shortened sail."</FIDquotes> Colonel Howard kindly sought for the easiest steps, and helped the helpless Caroline Owen, who had neither the energy of some of the party, nor the ambition of others, to carry her forward. West was too happy in soothing Miss Panton's real and affected fears, as she declared, <FIDquotes>"that she could not raise her eyes for the world; her head was giddy, she must fall if she attempted to look at the horrid gulph below,"</FIDquotes> and she clung closer to his arm. Elizabeth and Bently enjoyed a walk which danger and difficulty only made more agreeable. After an hour's steep climbing they suddenly turned short on a little natural platform, full in front of the cascade, which, flashing down the rough face of the opposite mountain, thundered in the ravine below. The very earth under their feet trembled with the roar of the waters, which, <Metaphor>wheeling impetuously round</Metaphor>, hurried, white in foam, through the valley the party had just left.

A brilliant rainbow threw its glittering arch across the spray, which in ceaseless shower moistened many a fair floweret. Caroline Owen shrieked and clasped her hands over her eyes, begging to be taken <FIDquotes>"from such a horrid, frightful place,"</FIDquotes> and continued to disturb the enjoyment of the whole party, until her request was complied with. <Sententia>The grand features of nature have an imposing and solemnizing effect upon minds not deeply merged in egotism and vanity.</Sententia> The hurrying mass of waters, overleaping all obstacles, and for ever rushing forward, <Metaphor>like headstrong youth accelerating its own course to the ocean of eternity,</Metaphor> disposed even Harriet Panton for a moment to be serious. West only thought and gazed on her; he seemed perfectly willing to float in her company gaily along the stream of life, enjoying the present, and regardless of the future. The scene before them was a subject upon which Bendy and Elizabeth could freely interchange thoughts; <Sententia>and perhaps the human heart is incapable of a deeper feeling of delight, than that afforded by the discovery that a beloved object thinks exactly as we think, and feels as we do; that there is perfect harmony in the thoughts, and unity in the feelings; that the emotions of two souls rise from one source; for the higher our enthusiasm soars the more do we value the heart that can participate in it.</Sententia>

Colonel Howard standing a little apart, regarded, with a benignant smile, the group before him, exhilirated by air and exercise, and the bright hopes and visions of the future, which, <Metaphor>like the bow of promise over the tumult beneath</Metaphor>, passed over their youthful minds, sparkling the brighter for their airy and undefinable nature, and by their lustre throwing all life's sober realities into shade.

They could have lingered for hours had not Captain Kentledge reminded them that <FIDquotes>"they must about ship, and steer for the caverns, which were worth seeing, and large enough to stow away a dozen vessels like the Cumberland."</FIDquotes> Doctor Pillet thrusting himself forward to know what Was in agitation (more anxious to hear what was said, than observant of where he set his foot), unwarily trod upon a bunch of dry grass, on the edge of the path, which slipped from under his tread, and sent him rolling from bush to bush all the way down the hill. A general scream from the ladies made Captain Kentledge turn sharp round; he ran to the brink, and in an instant saw, that from the direction the Doctor took there was no serious cause of alarm. From the time, as Captain Kentledge expressed it, that the Doctor got under weigh, leaving a broad wake behind him, he rolled on his side down the smooth slope, and by the impetus of his own motion, like a lob shot, passed over the straggling bushes, which tended however to retard the celerity of his movement, until at length, after a voyage which gave every one time to witness it, he was quietly deposited in a shallow pool which the stream had left under the bank. <DiaM>"There he is, safe at anchor," <M>said the Captain,</M> "merely a little damaged in his rigging I think, but we must bear a hand to get him into his right course. I doubt his tackle is in bad condition; look at him splashing and throwing up the sand like a grampus in the shallows."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"O Doctor! Doctor! that I were there to help you," <M>screamed Miss Panton, charmed with the sight</M>; "you would not find me <i>disremembering</i> the obligations I owe you."</DiaM> By this time several of the gentlemen had scrambled down to the poor Doctor's assistance, and found him scratched and peevish, and though not much hurt, his clothes were torn, wet through, and his hat had been carried away by the stream, to remedy which loss, his friend Miss Panton, as soon as the whole party had collected at the bottom of the hill, insisted upon his tying her pocket handkerchief over his head, <FIDquotes>"to prevent," <M>as she said,</M> "the bad effects of the sun on his brain, or at all events upon the place where it ought to be."</FIDquotes> This accident put a stop to all further exploring. Miss Panton was of opinion, <FIDquotes>"that the last act of the entertainment had been better got up than any she could have imagined, and was worth fifty old caverns; to see a waterfall was nothing, but to see her dear Doctor fall into the water, was well worth all the trouble she had endured."</FIDquotes></SceneAction>

<SceneQuasi>Next morning a waggon for the ladies, and horses for the gentlemen, stood ready to convey them to the capital of Southern Africa, twenty-one miles distant; half the road was very steep and rugged, over large masses of stone, sunk deep in sand, and rendered still more rough, by the fragments of rock which successive storms had severed from the mountains above, and rolled down into the road. The vehicle was drawn by eight good well trained horses, and guided by a Cafire charioteer, who managed his steeds, and held his reins with a grace which would have done credit to any member of the four in band. His assistant, seated by him, applied, as occasion required, his enormous long whip, like a fishing rod, leaving him at perfect liberty to attend to his own part of the duty. The waggon was well covered in, and defended from the weather; which now began to wear a very inauspicious appearance, but, as it was not upon springs, Colonel Howard warned the ladies to expect rough riding. They were no sooner seated, than away they went full trot, over the street of Simon's Town; <Exclamation>and such a street!</Exclamation> They were utterly unable to draw breath until they cleared the town, and descended to the water's edge, skirting the bay, with the flowing tide rolling up under their horses' feet. The wind began to rise, and the surf to beat in upon the rocks, as they rose upon the promontory which defends the southern side of the bay, and wheeling rapidly round it, again descended at the same pace to circle the head of Else Bay. The steep mountains over head, and the equally steep rocks descending to the sea, were covered with the same variety of flowers, holding together the sand, which in spite of them, as the wind every moment increased, became excessively annoying. At the head of the bay, where their road lay upon the fine level sand, they were almost blinded; it rose in whirlwinds, and blowing from the shore, in face of the opposing surf, almost seemed like snow drift. Still, under the guidance of their skilful charioteer, they held on their pace, mounting upon one side and descending upon the other, by the promontories by which this succession of little bays are bounded, over the same loose rough road without ever drawing bridle. Fish-hook Bay presented a wild and dreary scene, nearly destitute of vegetation. It derives its name from the number of whales which are killed there; their enormous bones, in ponderous masses, lay whitening in the winds. A few rude huts, belonging to the fishermen, almost wholly constructed of these bleached bones, rather increased than diminished the solitary and desolate character of the  scene; even the little patches of neglected culture, were enclosed by the same debris. Behind, the mountains rose in inaccessible steepness; in front, the chafed sea, vexed by opposing rocks, spread in foam in the troubled air. Still they held on, the horsemen closing round the carriage, to give by their presence at least the comfort which society could inspire; the noise of the elements effectually prevented the interchange of words. It was with great pleasure that they gained the pass of Musenburgh, emerging at once into an open country and a good road. In the gorge of the pass, though half buried in flowers, they remarked the furnaces for heating shot, and the piles of cannon balls, which the Dutch had used in their ineffectual struggle to defend that strong post against British valour. The country assumed a distinctly different appearance, as they left the sea and crossed over the flat leading to Cape Town. The mountains on the left hand ran round the plain, in a semicircular sweep, showing on their gentle acclivity several substantial country houses and neat villages rising from the trees which embowered them. On the left a wide and level plain extended from the head of False Bay, which they had just left (the small bays being merely indentures of its capacious basin), to Table Bay, showing by its salt marshy appearance that it had been formed by an accumulation of sand thrown up by the waters of both bays. Several large windmills, <Metaphor>with their spread arms,</Metaphor> broke the level. Near the capital pretty villas and snug substantial wide-eaved Dutch houses, covered with vines and surrounded with vineyards, outhouses, cattle, and poultry, showed the abundant style of their living.

Emerging from a little wood, a turn of the road gave them the first view of Table Mountain, rearing his grey bald rocky forehead over all others. The outline, though certainly bearing the character of table land, is much more picturesque and irregular than prints usually give it; and its magnitude and elevation constitute it sublime. To our friends the sight of this grand mountain amply compensated for all the fatigue they had undergone; and it may be supposed that travelling over such a road, at such a pace, and in a vehicle without springs, was not a ride to be soon forgotten, independent of the weather they experienced in the commencement of their journey. Accommodation had been secured for them at one of the principal boarding-houses, where they arrived just before dark, and fatigued by their unwonted mode of travelling, were glad, at an early hour in the evening, to retire to repose.</SceneQuasi> Very many of the respectable Dutch families take in boarders, which, as the Cape is a place of resort for strangers, they find a lucrative concern; indeed the family establishment is that of a table d'hôte, where strangers may dine or sup at so much a head, and under the superintendance of clever managing Dutch women. The slaves are neat and clean in their appearance, and orderly in their attendance. Miss Percy and her sister occupied the same room, and Flora one within theirs. <ScenePerception>After a tempestuous night, a bright morning sun threw its beams into their chambers, and waked them from rest as sound as it had been refreshing. How great was their pleasure and surprise, upon going to their window, to perceive Table Mountain just opposite to them, every large and rugged feature clearly made out in the thin morning air. While they were gazing upon it with an intensity of delight, it underwent, like the shifting of a dream, an instant change, which for a moment startled them. A breeze of wind rolled a volume of fog over the head of the mountain, which, like a curtain, dropped instantly before it; the return of the blast as speedily swept it up again, <Metaphor>like spray,</Metaphor> leaving the mountain as before; and again it descended <Metaphor>like the flashing of a cataract.</Metaphor> The appearance was so very different to any thing they had ever witnessed, that it produced a corresponding effect upon their minds, and they turned alternately to gaze upon the mountain, and then upon each other, as the light breeze enveloped or unveiled its majestic form.</ScenePerception>

<SceneDia><Trigger>On entering</Trigger> the breakfast-room they found Colonel Howard and Captain Bently eagerly perusing a file of Bengal Gazettes, in which they appeared much interested. On their entrance they arose to meet them, anxiously inquiring how they had passed the night, and if they had recovered from their fright and fatigue. Colonel Howard gaily observed, that the reappearance of the roses was answer sufficient to his question; his own colour was a little higher than usual, his manner more hurried, and he shook hands with them all, with even more than his usual affection. Charlotte looked at her uncle; it was evident something which he strove to suppress had occurred to disturb his generally calm and benignant deportment; what it was she could not conjecture, unless indeed (which she was almost inclined to think), Captain Bently had been speaking to him of her sister. She turned to observe if there was any thing in Bently's manner to warrant the conclusion; and saw him standing by the window, talking earnestly, but in a low voice to Elizabeth, whose hand he held, and over whose pale cheek a tear fell, notwithstanding her efforts to prevent it. Colonel Howard's eye followed hers, and at once perceiving that Elizabeth was acquainted with the intelligence he had that moment received, he said, with his usual composure, <DiaQ>"My dear girls, I did not mean to tell you until you had finished breakfast, a refreshment you must want after such a day's service as we had yesterday, that I find by these Bengal papers my corps is ordered upon service, and also my friend Bently's."</DiaQ> Up to this point Elizabeth had struggled with her tears, but she could do so no longer, her self-command forsook her, and hiding her face in her handkerchief, she indulged in the relief thus granted. Her sister's sorrow sanctioned hers, and in a measure covered the too marked appearance which in other circumstances it would have borne. <DiaM>"My dear uncle," <M>said Charlotte, grasping his hand,</M> "but you you will not be obliged to go with it;"</DiaM> and Flora, with the affection of a daughter, took the other, as they both looked up in his face for his expected answer. <DiaM>“Yes, my dear girls," <M>he replied, with an affectionate pressure of the hand,</M> "I must leave you sooner than I wished, or indeed expected; but I shall leave you in the kind care of my sister, Mrs. Russell, whom you will soon learn to love."</DiaM> Then calling Elizabeth to him, he folded her to his heart and bid her be of good cheer; <FIDquotes>"though he did take the field, there was not much prospect of hard service, and he would most probably be with them in Calcutta before the cold weather was over."</FIDquotes> He had for some time suspected the state of Bently's feelings; and during the few days they had been on shore, where more frequent and unrestrained intercourse gave him a better opportunity of judging, he had often thought, and this morning made it clear, that it was not without return. He felt that it would be cruel to permit explanations which could only lead to an engagement perhaps hopeless, and resolved therefore neither to see or to hear more than was intended for him. He took the first opportunity of explaining to Charlotte his feelings; and advised her, without seeming to intend it, to prevent by her presence Bently's declaring his sentiments. <Dia>"If they are sincere and lasting, my dear Charlotte, it will be time enough at the termination of the campaign. If they are not, or if it is his fate to fall, it will be well to spare our dear Elizabeth the additional sorrow which further intimacy and declared affection would lay up in store for her."</Dia></SceneDia> Charlotte perfectly agreed in the justice of his remarks, and resolved, as far as was in her power, to act upon them, though she felt that it would be difficult to avoid speaking with Elizabeth on a subject which engrossed her whole mind; <FID>on board it would be easier</FID>; they were never alone, the other ladies being their companions all the day, and their servant occupying the same cabin at night, precluding the possibility of private conversation. <SceneQuasi>Breakfast was a dull and uncomfortable meal, all seemed more disposed to revolve their own thoughts in silence, than to communicate them to each other. <Trigger>When it was finished</Trigger> Colonel Howard desired the young ladies to get their bonnets, that he might have the pleasure of showing them the lions, <FIDquotes>"real African lions, as the bills intimate,"</FIDquotes> adding, <DiaQ>"a walk in the fresh air will do you good. So, my dear Elizabeth, go, I shall wait your return."</DiaQ> Bently made a movement as if he would go too, but Colonel Howard's intention of waiting fell like a weight upon his action. <FID>Why should he wish to entangle Elizabeth Percy in his doubtful fate? Colonel Howard evidently dreaded it. Was it not more honourable to resist the temptation, and suffer in silence?</FID> To determine the point he snatched up his hat,</SceneQuasi> and took the shortest road to Table Mountain, walking fast, and pressing earnestly up its rugged ascent, <Metaphor>as if by climbing he could rise above the thoughts which tormented him,</Metaphor> until exhausted by his efforts, he stopped to consider the revolution which a few hours had produced in his feelings and prospects. <ScenePerception>When he met Elizabeth Percy in the morning, fresh in renovated spirits and youthful beauty, and advanced to greet her, he still held the Gazette which he had been perusing open in his hand; upon which her downcast eye unconsciously rested, as with a sweet smile she listened to his eager inquiries after her health; and it was not until a sudden change of colour marked the cause, that he observed her eye had fallen upon the general orders, where the number of the corps appeared for service, and discovered what he meant to have taken a fitter opportunity to reveal; he took her trembling hand, and whispered words of comfort, when Colonel Howard, calling her from him, prevented what would undoubtedly have brought on a full disclosure of his feelings.</ScenePerception> <ThoughtSummary>Now, when he had leisure to reflect, he saw the madness of such a proceeding, and resolved, in the fervor of disinterested love, to resist the temptation. <MonologueThought>"Shall I selfishly seek to bind her, ingenuous and lovely as she is, to my uncertain fortune; should I fall, I have put the means of providing for her as she deserves out of my own power; shall I involve her in suffering and misery by taking advantage of her love?"</MonologueThought> <FID>Of Elizabeth Percy's love!</FID> The thought was rapture, and for a time triumphed over all others. But again, the certainty that the instant they reached Calcutta he must leave her, surrounded, as he felt she would be, with the attentions and assiduities of others, leave her (if they ever met again) for an indefinite period, was torture. Then he was going, and his dark eye flashed at the thought, where he might have an opportunity of distinguishing himself, and returning with honour to claim his reward. On the high spot he had attained he paced for hours backwards and forwards in the mist, which, <Metaphor>like the tumultuous thoughts agitating his bosom, now descended in dark volumes, and then rolled back again, leaving the prospect clear</Metaphor>.</ThoughtSummary>

<ScenePerception>The rest of the party had a long walk round the town and its environs. Silent and dispirited, Elizabeth, for the first time, found that even the charms of fine scenery failed to interest her. Her attention was, however, roused to inquire, <DiaQ>"What is that?"</DiaQ> as the low notes of a muffled drum struck her ear. <DiaM>"Conveying some brave fellow to his last rest," <M>said Captain Kentledge.</M></DiaM> As he spoke a soldier's funeral slowly crossed the way. Elizabeth burst into tears, as an incident not of unfrequent occurrence in a military garrison, came to her like an omen of fate. The sword of the deceased, crossed with its scabbard upon his coffin, showed that he was an officer; the white hat-bands of his brethren in arms told that he was young, and his horse led slowly after his cold remains, his boots dangling loose from the saddle, spoke his place left empty. The band solemnly performed the dead march in Saul, to which the deep-toned single strokes of the bass-drum gave powerful emphasis. The wailing notes of the trumpets, prolonged by the mountain echoes, smote on Elizabeth's heart. By degrees the sound became fainter and fainter as the files moved slowly on, and at length died away, merely running in echoes round the mountains, <Metaphor>like the lament of spirits in the air</Metaphor>; then the loud discharge of musketry told that all was closed, as company after company fired successive volleys over the lowly laid head of him who could no more awake, in darkness and in silence, until the last trumpet shall say, "Arise."</ScenePerception>

<SceneAction>Captain Bently did not make his appearance at dinner, and many were the conjectures as to the cause of his absence. <FID>Captain Willoughby had seen him go towards the mountain,</FID> intelligence which drew from Captain Kentledge a long animadversion upon the folly of attempting to ascend in a fog, the danger of losing his way, or meeting with wild animals, <FID>alone, and unarmed as he was.</FID> Poor Elizabeth was forced to hear a detail of many dismal accidents, and a full enumeration of all the dangers Bently had exposed himself to. Miss Owen indeed was <FIDquotes>"almost certain,"</FIDquotes> that something of the kind had really happened, as she never knew him to absent himself without cause; and in wondering and conjecturing what that cause could be, it never occurred to her, that she was rousing any deeper feeling than idle curiosity.

Colonel Howard <FIDquotes>"thought," <M>with more probability,</M> "that he had in his rambles fallen in with some of his Bengal friends, with whom he might choose to spend the day."</FIDquotes> As the evening advanced all the doors were set open; and the family with whom they lodged took their seats in the verandah, to receive visits, talk with those in the street, and arrange their little tea drinking parties. The old Dutchmen smoked, their wives entertained their company, and the young entertained themselves with their guitars, and other instruments. Miss Percy proposed that they should take the opportunity which a charming evening presented of seeing the Cape by moonlight, a proposal to which Colonel Howard acceded, and <Blend>they all sallied forth,</Blend> under the light which Lord Byron has so exquisitely described:

<QuotedLit>Each flower the dews have lightly wet,
And in the sky the stars are met,
And on the wave a deeper blue,
And on the leaf a browner hue,
And in the heaven, that clear obscure,
So softly dark and darkly pure, 
That follows the decline of day,
As twilight melts beneath the moon away.</QuotedLit>

As they passed through the streets, they found many gay groups enjoying, what at the Cape is the greatest pleasure of the day, their evening promenade. On the Jetée the whole beauty and fashion of Cape Town were assembled, talking and laughing, Elizabeth could not help saying, as unconcernedly as if they had been in any ordinary place, and had not the noble mountain terminating their view on one hand, and its bay on the other. The bright beams of a splendid sun had failed to interest her in the morning. Now the mellow light of the soft moon harmonized more with her state of spirits, and the mild, pure, cool fanning breeze, seemed to unchain feelings which had remained during the day pent up, a dull and oppressive weight. <MonlogueThought>"Why should I wish," <M>she asked herself, as she silently sauntered by her uncle's side,</M> "why should I wish to clog Bently's ardent mind in the discharge of his duty. I am too well acquainted with his noble nature, to suppose that even my love could make him happy in the neglect of it;"</MonlogueThought> and in the sweet conviction, that though for her he would sacrifice life, yet for her he would not swerve from duty, she found an anchor on which to rest her hopes, and seemed ready, in the confidence of pure affection, to use the words of Holy Writ, and say, <SpeechImagined><QuotedLit>"Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it."</QuotedLit></SpeechImagined>By degrees her mind became more calm, and she tasted something of the comfort which her uncle tried to afford her. He spoke not of Bently, but he spoke of the campaign, and the general opinion that it could not be of long duration, and that it would terminate the war in India. With a soldier's feeling, he spoke of the gallant leader, General Auchterlony, who commanded the army, and his full confidence in the success of any enterprise committed to his care. On the Jetée they were joined by Bently, who introduced the gentleman by whom he was accompanied, as his friend Mr. Fortescue, of the Bengal Civil Service. Colonel Howard had before met with him in India, <FIDambig>and was pleased with this opportunity of renewing the acquaintance. His elegant manners rendered him a welcome addition to the party.</FIDambig> Offering his arm to Miss Percy, he proposed, as he had been several months resident at the Cape, to act as Cicerone for the evening. His intelligent conversation, and animated remarks, doubled the pleasure of a really delightful walk. They stopped at a favorable point of sight, to consider Table Mountain and Lion Hill, under a new aspect. The former reposed in calm moon-light, the latter deep in shade; its dark outline clearly relieved off the blue starry sky, exactly resembled the couchant form of the animal whose name it bears. Miss Percy remarked, <FIDquotes>"that the resemblance was so perfect, and the proportions so large, that she could almost fancy it the slumbering genius of Africa."</FIDquotes> <DiaM>"Yes," <M>said the Colonel,</M> "the genius of Africa does slumber. O that he would arise, and shake from his mane the oppression under which he has so long groaned!"</DiaM>

Delighted with the night, the climate, and the scene, they lingered out until a late hour.</SceneAction> Almost all their remaining evenings at the Cape were spent in the same manner. Mr. Fortescue was their daily companion. Superior as was his personal appearance, graceful and attentive as his conduct certainly was, still there was no particularity in his attentions; no effort to recommend himself, no study in his actions, no emphasis upon his words meant to convey <DoxaQuotes>"more than met the ear."</DoxaQuotes> He seemed to feel the pleasure in the society of the Miss Percys, and their friend Miss Hume, which well principled and well educated men enjoy in the conversation of amiable and accomplished women; and very much regretted that his passage to Bengal had been taken in another vessel, before the arrival of the Cumberland at Simon's Bay.

Captain Kentledge hurried forward his operations. As soon as they were completed, <AuthorWe>our party</AuthorWe> returned to Simon's Town, and the signal was again made for sailing.
