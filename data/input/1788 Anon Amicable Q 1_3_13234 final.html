<ChapEpigraph>The laws of social benevolence require that every man should endeavour to assist others by his experience. He that has at last escaped into port from the fluctuations of chance, and the gusts of opposition, ought to make some improvements in the chart of life, by marking the rocks on which he has been dashed, and the shallows where he has been stranded.

<ChNameIntro>Sir Harry Hyndley</ChNameIntro> and his lady had long flourished in the most splendid scenes of fashionable magnificence. During twenty years they had graced the annals of matrimony by the best-bred dissension, which, fostered by acrimony and time, at length expanded into the most reputable species of conjugal and reciprocal detestation.<ChNameIntro>Lady Hyndley</ChNameIntro> was childishly fond of inordinate and frivolous pleasure; she was one of those common charaters who are never happy but in a crowd. Sir Harry, who had a person uncommonly fine, was a gross voluptuary, depraved in principles, riotous in enjoyment, without wit, without sentiment, without elegance. They had no children to promote fondness, or to check hatred. Separate companions, and separate pleasures, were the natural consequences of their polite alienation; and among the friends selected by Lady Hyndley as her favourites, she particularly distinguished a student of Oxford.<ChNameIntro>Sir Stephen Bruce</ChNameIntro> was an intimate friend of Sir Harry Hyndley, who was intrusted with the care of his son during the residence of Sir Stephen in Scotland.

The young man, therefore, passed every vacation, and every leisure hour, with Lady Hyndley. He received her attentions with gratitude, but gave no encouragement to those kindnesses which were lavished with more tenderness than propriety. Her ladyship was not old, but was yet <QuotedLit>"<i>touched by the tender hand of mellowing time.</i>"</QuotedLit> She was, perhaps, at that age indicated by Voltaire, when he says <QuotedLit><i>"L'amour est le plus grand des maux quand il n'est le plus grand des biens.</i>"</QuotedLit> The object of her partiality was placed next her in every company, with an ill-bred and rude preference of him to people of higher rank and unquestionable superiority. At table she always fed him with the nicest <i>morceaux</i>, culled with solicitous delicacy from the most exquisite dishes. He attended her to all places of public amusement, and to every private party, where, from his frequent appearance, he soon became an accustomed guest. This intimacy occasioned many hints and sneers; but the rigid propriety, and occasional coldness, exhibited by Bruce, whenever Lady Hyndley's friendship became too fervid, effecually prevented every other ill consequence but the displeasure of Sir Harry. Weary of conjectures, the truth of which they could not ascertain, the attentive friends of Lady Hyndley thought it necessary <DoxaQuotes>"<i>not to know what to think.</i>"</DoxaQuotes>

<ChNameIntro>George Bruce</ChNameIntro>, the son of Sir Stephen Bruce, was bred at Eton, and had studied at Queen's for three years. At the age of twenty-one he was entitled to a small independent fortune, left him by a relation of his mother. Lady Bruce was married when very young to Sir Stephen, who being of a disposition untameably ferocious, treated his wife with cruelty, and his son with oppression. They had little intercourse; for Sir Stephen denied his son that income to which his rank entitled him, and prohibited any correspondence between George and his mother.

<ChPortrait>The person of Bruce was formed with that happy mixture of masculine firmness and graceful elegance which a painter would choose for the representation of manly beauty: he was not slim, but was perfectly <i>arrondi.</i> His eyes dark, sparkling, and intelligent; his voice clear and energetic; his manners regulated by that invariable ease which is the charateristic of high-breeding. Though his intelletual capacity was uncommonly great, he was yet an eccentric mixture of romantic sentiment and volatile carelessness.

He was like Anthony, <QuotedLit>"<i>for his bounty there was no winter in it;</i>"</QuotedLit> and his munificence was not confined to the mere splendour of indolent donation, but was displayed in assiduous endeavours to serve and assist. One favourite propensity, the effect of a noble disposition, had often led him into ridiculous situations, by which he was exposed to the laughter of his acquaintance; this was the <i>enthusiasm of friendship</i>, which glowed in his heart with such uncommon rapture and such invariable philanthropy, that his whole study was to admire every one he knew of both sexes, and to bind himself to them by the strongest ties of inviolable attachment. Bruce had engraved upon his mind all those sublime and glittering precepts of poets and philosophers, which generally aggrandize sentimental effusion, and consecrate disinterested regard, without insuring or ce- menting any solid friendlhip. By an unwearied endeavour to serve and to oblige, he had attracted the admiration of many individuals who were incapable of stability in their resolutions, or suavity in their disspositions, and thus, by a pliant acquiescence, he had kept secure posseflion of their favour. Ever ardent to cultivate the goodwill of mankind, fearful of offending, and ambitious of possessing an unlimited ac\quaintance, he perhaps sometimes forfeited his dignity, and disgraced his abilities, by a blind submission to the <i>dictamina</i> of his companions.</ChPortrait>

Such was the man who by rigid censors was called the <i>minion</i> of Lady Hyndley, and whom Sir Harry would have been happy to repulse without injury or injustice. He doubted not but that he was a gallant suitor for his lady's favours, and therefore wanted nothing but due prowess to dismiss his guest. The excessive cordiality and politeness of Bruce rendered the attempt unsuccessful. He perpetually expressed such a regard for his host, such a high sense of the ties of friendship, that it was almost impossible to insult a man, who every hour exhibited in his behaviour new instances of amiable beneficence. Sir Harry at last apprehended, that since her ladyship was so hospitable, it might not ill become him to imitate her generosity with equal ardour. Previous, therefore, to Bruce's next visit, he gave orders for a chamber to be got ready, and preparations to be made, for the reception of a lady who had before frequently visited Lady H. <SceneQuasi>He went out the next morning, and returned in his carriage with a young lady, whose elegant deportment and animated beauty interested every one in her favour, and deprecated that aversion which all felt at this singular introduction. Sir Harry presented her to Lady Hyndley with there words; <DiaQ>"I must intreat that <i>you</i> will be as affectionate to your female friends as I have been. I introduce this lady to you as a woman I value <i>next to yourself</i>; I shall be happy to give our friend Bruce so agreeable a companion; his fidelity and attachment to our house deserve our best endeavours to make it agreeable to him."</DiaQ> Her ladyship felt the sneer, but prudently resisted the impulse to resent it. She received her new guest civilly, and, to the astonishment of every one, Miss Bryant was allowed by her own friends, and prevailed upon by Sir Harry, to remain some time in his family.</SceneQuasi>

<SceneDia>The next day Bruce arrived. He was, as usual, received with that prodigality of friendship, which he knew so well how to recompense and to retain; his anxious endeavours to please revived all those sentiments in his favour which had perpetually influenced the whole family; and such were his powers of exciting esteem, that even Sir Harry reproached himself for thinking with severity of so amiable a companion.

The intimacies of Bruce were formed upon principles very different from those which cement ordinary friendships. The faults, follies, and foibles of their acquaintance, are frequently the inducements which bring together people of a <i>gregarious</i> disposition and visitors who furnish ample food for censure and laughter are often received with open arms: Bruce, on the contrary, found in the slightest acquaintance some virtue or some recommendation; and he carried his reverence for their qualities to a ludicrous height. On all other subjects he conversed rationally, and sometimes elegantly; but as soon as the enthusiasm of friendship was excited, it overwhelmed his discretion, and clouded his perspicacity. <Trigger>When</Trigger> Sir Harry introduced him to Miss Bryant, with some forced encomiums on his high character for cordiality in friendships, Bruce readily quitted the beaten track of customary compliment, to launch out into his favourite subject. <Dia>"I have been often amazed, Mr. Bruce, at the number of your acquaintance; how do you manage to attach and to preserve so numerous a body of people? I think I have met with very few who are in possession of so many connections."</Dia> —- <Dia>"Very few, indeed, Sir Harry; I pique myself with some reason, I believe, on the wide circle to which I am allied; my present complement is - let me see-  Eighty - then, fifty Hampshire - six at Scilly - the privy counsellor's three aunts - fourteen - Ay, ay - the present complement is one hundred and fifty-three: to which add my nineteen intimates in Russia, whom I never saw, and you will not find me <i>very</i> destitute."</Dia> The company smiled, and Sir Harry was pleased with the amicable phrenzy: <Dia>"I wonder how you can endure some of the odd traits which I think you must occasionally meet with in some characters, and especially where neither your interest nor your pleasure is concerned."</Dia> - <Dia>"Pardon me, Sir Harry, I have not a single friend, but who possesses some valuable talent; even the most common acquaintance I acknowledge is dear to me by the superiority of some splendid merit; and I consider my integrity and judgment equally pledged for the discovery of his virtues."</Dia> - <Dia>"A discernment less than your's, Mr. Bruce, could never descry any real worth in your new friend Sir Dudley Drone, a man absolutely devoid of all ideas, and who seems born for no other purpose but to sleep: he neither gives nor receives pleasure; he is ignorant, indolent, and absent; in short, I never saw a man less <i>companionable</i>."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Ah! dear sir, you know not half his merits; he is neither passionate, arrogant, nor impertinent; he hears every thing which is said in every company with the most patient attention; he never raises your expectations of his abilities too high, and of course never disappoints you; so far from assuming any character which he is unequal to, I have passed a week in his society at his own house, and never heard him speak the whole time."</Dia> - <Dia>"'Pon my word, a most agreeable man ! Well then, there's another acquaintance of your's I once met, Bob Panic, who is "always plaguing people with fears for their health, <i>because he has not seen them so long</i>, though it often happens that he has dined with them the day before; the last time I encountered him he went through all the symptoms of gout, palsy, and pleurisy, to prove to me that I had got a bilious fever."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Sir, I hardly know a more excellent man than Bob Panic; his only failing is, that he distresses his own mind for the welfare of his friends, in which, perhaps, he a little resembles me; his anxiety if he does not often see you; his solicitude to suggest means for your being better than you are, even if you are ever so well; his caution in not suffering you to deceive yourself into an opinion of being in health because you look so, or feel so; and, above all, his power of magnifying every misfortune and every danger, that you may be quite prepared against it; there, Sir, speak a man a true friend, and I, who have so often experienced his bounties, must always reverence my good friend Bob Panic."</Dia> - <Dia>"You speak very highly of him, which is surely more than you can do of his brother-in-law Ned Schism."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Pardon me, I think him one of the most useful and equitable characters I know; he is famous for cementing those friendships which by some unlucky perverseness or misunderstanding have been separated; and his great merit is; that he never allows people who have quarrelled to meet with a view to reconciliation, till he has made all parties acquainted with the mutual asperity which both have exhibited in each other's absence; he has a noble memory and he is always able to relate, with incredible accuracy, the whole vocabulary of abuses and menaces which he has collected from either side, together with all the different shades of insinuation and figures of abhorrence: thus you see every one acts under reciprocal conviction and cannot again give way to the violence of their temper, with the salvo of having been trepanned into good will <i>under false pretences</i>."</Dia> ——

<Dia>"Well, Sir, these people have doubtless great recommendations, and they are much superior to another man, whose want of education and good sense would, I should apprehend, totally preclude an intimacy between you; I mean Peter Le Pied."</Dia> --- <Dia>"Bless me, Sir Harry, he is one for whom I have a very sincere regard, as well for his elegant accomplishments as for his manly virtues: Sir, he is the best dancer I know! he treads most learnedly; he cannot ask you how you do, but you may see he has been taught to dance! Even his mind, Sir, is always moving in an intellectual minuet; all the world know it; his fame might entitle him to a dancing diploma for opening every ball he goes to; and I doubt not but his minutest <i>pas</i> will reach posterity: then his temper is as flexible as his toes; he bows benevolently; there is a kind of probity in his mode of being true to the time whenever he exhibits: he keeps time so much better than--" "He keeps his word - which he will, I believe, break to his dearest friend, upon the most solemn occasion."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Sir Harry, we are not all perfect; and, I think myself bound by every tie of agility, to maintain the friendship of Peter Le Pied."</Dia> -- <Dia>"And pray, Mr. Bruce, give me leave to ask, Are the motives equally cogent which united you in friendship with Billy Tipple, the meagre toastmaster, who drinks three bottles in an hour?"</Dia> -— <Dia>"Certainly! It is not his intemperance that I admire; no, Sir Harry, it is his valour and fortitude; it is resolution exhibited upon many occasions, that shews him to be possessed of a genuine courage which marks the truly brave: my poor praises, however, would be faint, if you could once see him in his proper sphere, if you could view him glowing with natural ardour, and with unshaken firmness; for instance now, if you saw him take physic! Ah! Sir Harry, the prowess with which he swallowed two pilis and a saline draught! Never shall I forget, when struggling with a cold, which he got by shaving in a hard frost, how he spurned, with a generous indignation, the remedies of abstinence, which his great soul could not brook ! No, Sir, with that undaunted spirit which he may so justly boast, he encountered a sudorific potion of white wine whey; he then went to sleep, submitting for four hours and an half to the ignominious bondage of the bed-chamber: his fever abated; but his mind, Sir, was neither elevated by success, nor sunk by imprisonment; no longer, then, let us say with a malignant and narrow prejudice, that 

<QuotedLit>Heroes are much the same, the point's agreed,
From Macedonia's madman to the Swede.</QuotedLit>

Far be it from those who are illumined by the rays of Tipple's heroism; far be it from such to deny that a great mind may exist in a slight person: let every one disposed to carp at lofty deeds consult the annals of my friend Tipple's courage and conduct; let them remember his achievements, and gladly offer that portion of praise which is so justly due to the chevalier <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>."</Dia>

The novelty of Bruce's predominating enthusiasm afforded Miss Bryant infinite entertainment; but she saw, or thought she saw, in him something more interesting than the peculiarity which he then exhibited: this sentiment, whatever it was, she too studiously endeavoured to conceal. <ArrivalDeparture>When the ladies retired to coffee</ArrivalDeparture>, Miss Bryant noticed Bruce's frailty: <Dia>"What a ridiculous propensity! nothing so ill becomes a man as to proclaim the imbecillity of his own mind; the handsomest man in the world must suffer from so dark a shade in his character: no, I could never bear Mr. Bruce, even if he said or thought the civillest things of me."</Dia>

Lady Hyndley was struck with the brisk censure from a girl not of a satirical disposition. <Dia>"You are severe upon my friend, and really without reason, for I doubt not but he is sincere in whatever he says; and if you consider how valuable a true friend is, you will respect his zeal, and honour his fidelity."</Dia> -- <Dia>"I shall think much better of him, Madam, since he is so ably defended; and, like you, I shall make it no less my duty than my pleasure to <i>contemplate</i> his little peculiarities."</Dia> -- <Dia>"If you favour us with your company during his residence with us, you will have leisure for permitting Mr. Bruce to increase the number of his friends; and I presume you have no one in your family who would object to your knowing the world by studying characters."</Dia> -— <Dia>"Your Ladyship is little acquainted with me, and still less with my friends, if you suppose they would not be anxious on the subject of my usurping attentions, to which I have no claim: I shall seriously consider myself selected pointedly as the object of your ridicule and disapprobation, if you think I do not thoroughly contemn Mr. Bruce's affected raptures; and, whatever excellence you may see in them, nothing can be more remote from my disposition than to lend my praise to such empty sentiments."</Dia> -- <Dia>"You are the first person who has not seen something amiable even in his errors."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Dear Ma'am, I am not obliged to be watching every body's virtues; my own go very well, and can never want to be regulated by the dial of every moralist I meet."</Dia> -- <Dia>"But, why imagine that the dial is so incorrect?"</Dia> -— <Dia>"Not at all, Madam; he is very true, and tells how love flies, that is, if you shine upon him."</Dia>

<ArrivalDeparture>Bruce and Sir Harry came in.</ArrivalDeparture> The latter, who was an intemperate feeder, had drank inordinately. He reeled up to Miss Bryant. <Dia>"My dear Emily, rob me of my bottle, if I don't love thee; I do, 'faith ! I'll have some coffee; it shall be strong as your sense: I'll put milk enough in to make it as soft, and sugar enough to make it as sweet as your disposition."</Dia> Miss Bryant was much confused at his improper behaviour. Lady Hyndley coloured, and told Bruce, in a whisper, to persuade Sir Harry to behave with due decorum. <Dia>"Alas! Madam, it is the business of my life to make friends; judge then, if I can be so weak as to tell them when they expose themselves."</Dia> -- <Dia>"But, my friend, is there not some very gentle manner in which you, with your usual good sense, could convey a reproof?"</Dia> - <Dia>"Dear Madam, no good sense ever conveyed a reproof: I see Sir Harry is totally wrong, therefore the last thing that will cure him is a reprimand. If he was sober, and in the right, he might, no doubt, be easily persuaded to alter his conduct."</Dia> Lady Hyndley interfered, and at last prevailed upon Sir Harry to sit down and drink his coffee. <Dia>"Well, I will be persuaded and good-natured! 'Faith your ladyship looks very well to-night; how I should love you if you were not married ! hey, Lady Hyndley? —— Nay; don't blush now, for it looks as if you understood me, and that I dare say you would not do for the world; besides, I have such ideas of the sacred purity of women's delicacy, that I am shocked to see them renounce the smallest particle of it. - Ah! Emily, my love! well, how do all do at home ? Is Sir Edward pretty well, and Lady Bryant, and young Mr. Bryant? How do they all go on there ? What a pretty, nice, little creature you are, Emily! I dare say your mother is very fond of you. --- Now, Mr. Bruce, I have drank my coffee, let's all go and take a stroll to the Opera; come - let us - let us."</Dia>

The rest of the party declined it, considering Sir Harry's situation; he only darted a look of vengeance at his lady for preventing the expedition, and then went off himself. The evening passed very agreeably, from the mutual endeavours of Bruce and Miss Bryant to contribute to the pleasure of Lady Hyndley, who had just prudence enough to be pleased with her company, when it was her interest not to offend them; <Sententia>a species of discretion not always displayed by persons <i>apparently</i> much wiser than her ladyship: in the <i>charlatannerie</i> of self-conceit, those who aspire at superiority may, without any one requisite for a valuable character, without sense, wisdom, good-humour, or politeness, soar above their companions by petulant and solicitous disdain.</Sententia></SceneDia>

CLARISSA.</ChapEpigraph>

THE elegant beauties of Emily Bryant had attracted the admiration of Bruce soon after his arrival at Sir Harry Hyndley's. She was just eighteen; her person finely formed, rather majestic and lofty, than insinuating and complacent: her accomplishments were various, her attachments violent, and her friendship indissoluble. She loved to oblige, but she loved also to controul; and she had blended, with a high sense of her own superior abilities, a spirit of resolute firmness and unyielding dignity. She entertained the most noble sentiments of virtue and had very high ideas of propriety; but, this sense of decorum would sometimes evaporate in the vindication of her own liberty. Her perfections, therefore, excited rather admiration than tenderness; her influence was that of irresistible sway, not of artless allurement. When Bruce first saw her, he was <QuotedLit>"<i>awe struck</i>,

And as he pass'd he worshipp'd.*" </QuotedLit><Footnote>*Comus</Footnote>

At the next interview he conversed with her as a pleasant companion, without expecting any information or any uncommon talents. Her accomplishments surprised him; her knowledge of the fine arts; the elegance with which she spoke; the taste with which she sung; the judgment with which she decided. He had seen many women possessed of single excellence but never had found so many qualities with so little pedantry. Emily was never arrogant on the subject of her talents, and she was seldom otherwise in the support of her humours. She gave her opinions with the most insinuating humility; she uttered her commands with imperious vehemence. The family of Sir Edward Bryant were much afraid of her attracting admirers unequal to her in fortune or in rank. She was loved by her father, and her mother indulged her in some caprices which ought to have been rectified in her early years. <ChNameIntro>Adrian degl' Uberti</ChNameIntro>, a foreigner of distinction, was the first suitor who aspired at the hand of Emily Bryant. His skill in music was incomparably great. He touched, <DoxaItalics><i>with flying fingers</i></DoxaItalics>, the harp and the organ. Every hearer was enraptured at the melody, which his delicate taste and exquisite skill always produced. But, with his harmony ended his power of entertainment. Dull and insensible to all the charms of intellectual supremacy, he was very ill calculated to excite the tenderners and esteem of such a mistress as Emily. She admired his melody, but when the music was finished, quitted him with readiness. Successive admirers approached; some with distant awe, some with pert familiarity, and others with elegant softness. But all these were either the sport, or the objecs of detestation, in the mind of Miss Byrant.

<SceneAction>In a few days, Sir Harry rode out. Bruce remained all the morning with Lady Hyndley, who was not very well, and Miss Bryant was retired to her own apartment. <Trigger>About three o'clock</Trigger> Sir Harry was inquired for by a young lady, who desired, if he was not at home, she might be permitted to wait for him. She was shewn into a room, and Bruce, hearing of it, had the curiosity to pass through, in order to take a view of her. Her form was noble, heightened by all the charms of natural beauty, but in her countenance appeared a ferocious and ghastly gloom, which inspired the beholder with horror and dismay. She had with her a beautiful child, who seemed about nine years old, whom, when Bruce entered, she was pressing to her bosom with convulsions of anguish, while the tears streamed incessantly from her eyes. The boy shewed a lively sense of his mother's sorrow; his heart swelled with tumultuous agony, and he kissed the tears from her eyes without being able to speak comfort to her. She rose at Bruce's entrance, and, with much confusion, endeavoured to recover herself. He advanced very respecfully, and addressed her with a tenderness which was one of the predominant features of his character: <Dia>"I find myself reprehensible, Madam, in thus intruding upon your sorrows ; had I known there was a stranger in distress, nothing would have prevailed upon me to interrupt you but the certainty that I could mitigate your affliction."</Dia> The lady during some time struggled for utterance; she at last overcame the conflict of fierceness and misery: <Dia>"I thank you, Sir, for the benevolent expressions to which I have no claim from a stranger; my wish to see Sir Harry Hyndley has, perhaps, made <i>me</i> an intruder. I should be sorry to interest any of his friends in my misfortunes, by an improper and unauthorised application to them on the subject of my present request. <i>My</i> woes are too common to excite admiration and too keen to admit remedy. You may yet, Sir, do me a very great service by concealing from Sir Harry that he is wanted by one in misery, and by directing him to be brought into this room when he returns."</Dia> - <Dia>"I perceive, Madam, you are little acquainted with me; you are ignorant that my name is Bruce. Do you now know me, Madam? Do you not recognize in me the friend of all mankind? Every body's brother; the humble efforts I have made to establish amity, and to dignify friendship, the noblest of all sentiments, have they never reached you?"</Dia> The lady, who could by no means comprehend the tenor of his discourse, sat silent for a few minutes; she then recollected herself, and replied: <DiaQ>"Of friendship, Sir, I have known so little that every thing respecting it is new to me but the sound; you profess yourself every body's friend, and I may, therefore, hope to be included in your good wishes. Pardon me if I say I neither expect or desire any thing more; I have been so long a stranger to all the tender offices of friendship and humanity, that I now only wish for sullen solitude; and I intreat you will not involve yourself in the gloom of my miseries, but leave me to indulge the wretchedness I am accustomed to."</DiaQ>

Bruce would have soothed her violent lamentations, but she so vehemently insited upon his quitting her, that he thought proper at last <ArrivalDeparture>to retire.</ArrivalDeparture>

<Blend>In an hour Sir Harry returned.</Blend> A servant, who opened the door of the room where the lady waited, observed him start at seeing her. <DiaQ>"Is it possible!"</DiaQ> was his exclamation as he entered, but he checked himself, and the servant could hear no more. They continued in the room above half an hour, when a violent shriek summoned the attention of every one near: Bruce, Lady Hyndley, Miss Bryant, and a train of servants, ran into the room, where they beheld Sir Harry supporting himself against a window, and as they entered he fell speechless on the floor: the lady was thrown on a sofa, her cloaths bloody, and in her hand a knife, with which she had wounded herself and Sir Harry Hyndley. The child was screaming in an agony of horror, and clasping the arm of his mother, who wrung his hand with looks of frantic despair. When she perceivd Lady Hyndley, she attempted to speak, and, after some efforts, delivered these words in a trembling yet emphatical voice:

<Dia>"On a wretch who has deprived me of fame and my innocence, by whose villainy I was precipitated from secure hapiness to the gulph of infamy and wretchedness, on that monster I have obtained the vengeance which my honour demanded. Execrations would now be vain and ungenerous; but something is due to my own fame, and I ought to declare, that he misled me, not by the depravity of my own passions, but by my love for him. He attached my heart when I was a stranger to guile, and led me through all the varieties of ungovernable fondness by insidious adulation; he then resigned me to disgrace and indigence, when I had no one to assist me but my God, or to soothe me but my child."</Dia> She turned to the boy with eager transport; <Metaphore>a ray of tenderness</Metaphore> shot from her eyes, and she kissed him with a look which no description could delineate. In the midst of her embraces a strong convulsion seized her, and, in a few minutes, she expired. None present could speak, for they were all <ItalicsOther><i>harrowed</i></ItalicsOther> with wonder and dread. Sir Harry, who recovered a little from his swoon, uttered a few words in a feeble voice: <Dia>"Before I die, let me intreat you, Lady Hyndley, to be kind to that child; if any consideration can expiate my crimes, it must be the welfare of that infant, of whom I am the father. As for you, I have amply recompenfed you in my will, for the uneasiness I may have given you in my life. Emily, my dear charming girl, let me embrace you; I have been your friend and your protector, and I hope you will not find I am unworthy your regard in my behaviour to you when you peruse my will. Commend me to your family; may your charms and your virtues be beloved as I have beloved them, and you will never want a friend. The hand of death is on me, and I grow dim; yet there is a secret I could wish you to - "</Dia> His voice then forsook him, and in violent pangs he terminated his existence.

The amazement with which every beholder was seized at the view of this scene, produced a long silence, till Miss Bryant, bursting into tears, poured forth the most piercing lamentations over the body of Sir Harry Hyndley: <Dia>"I have lost one who was so generous a friend, that I hoped he would have lived many years to honour me with his regard and his proteacion."</Dia> Lady Hyndley was astonished at her words, and a look of disdain, which shewed her sentiments, was darted at Emily with all the acrimony of lively detestation. Bruce, not in less agitation, took the child, who lay frantic upon his mother's corse, and, after trying to soothe his grief, inquired who he was. His name was Forrester, and they came that morning from <Cryptonym>*****</Cryptonym>, the place where his mother had formerly lived.</SceneAction>

<SceneQuasi>After the bodies were removed, and all assistance administered, though ineffectually, that could be thought of, the friends of Sir Harry Hyndley were sent to the next day, and upon opening the will, they found he had bequeathed the following legacies: To Lady Hyndley [pounds] 2000, in addition to her jointure, which was [pounds] 2,000 <i>per annum</i>; to Miss Bryant [pounds] 20,000, which was left in trust with her mother till she came of age; to Lady Bryant [pounds] 10,000, and to Sir Edward Bryant, in consideration of some acts of friendship, [pounds] 10,000. These, with a few others, were the only legacies he bequeathed.

Upon the perusal of the testament, Lady Hyndley, with a ferocity which she had never before displayed, broke out into expressions of aversion and reproach against Emily. She reprobated the memory of Sir Harry for throwing away so much money in what she styled <CharacterDiction><i>an infamous legacy</i></CharacterDiction> and concluded her aspersions by insisting upon the departure of Miss Bryant the next morning. Bruce, who hardly dared to interfere, lest his passion for Miss B. should be detected, with some address prevailed upon Lady Hyndley, <FIDquotes><i>for her own sake</i></FIDquotes>, to permit Emily's residence there till she could conveniently prepare for her departure.</SceneQuasi>

A question now arose: <SpeechInsert>"What was to be done with the child ?"</SpeechInsert> Lady Hyndley could not bear his presence for some time; but at last Bruce told her, that if she declined the protection of him, he himself would be at the expence of his education. Her ladyship blushed at her own want of humanity: the child was suffered to remain where he was.

Sir Harry Hyndley, but a few days before he died, had, with his fondness for Miss Bryant, privately made her a handsome present. She always appeared very wealthy, which might be expected from the opulence of her own family.

Emily, whose heart ever glowed with all the generous feelings for suffering humanity, and who found in benevolence the purest delight, took the present opportunity of displaying her munificence. She conferred with Bruce on the subject of the debts contracted by the unhappy female, whose error had been so fatal to herself and to Sir Harry: Emily then gave him fifty pounds, insisted upon his accepting it for the payment of them, and promised as much more as would satisfy the creditors if that was not sufficient. Bruce, whose income was not large, contributed a sum for the same purpose; but Lady Hyndley refused to hear of any subscription, or to afford the least trifle on such an occasion. Bruce asked her again; she frowned with disgust: <SpeechInsert>"Give them my warmest censure for being such fools as to trust such a "woman in distress."</SpeechInsert> - <SpeechInsert>"I certainly will, Madam, they shall have the widow's mite."</SpeechInsert>

<SceneDia>Bruce went to the mother's lodgings to get some intelligence of her friends, but without success. Nobody knew her; she had lived there for three years very privately, and no one ever came to visit her, but an old man who formerly brought her money. This person had not been there for some time; and it was supposed, when they heard the story, that the extremity of her indigence, and the keen sense of her injuries, had driven her to the desperate deed which she perpetrated. Bruce settled what little debts were due there, and then returned to Lady Hyndley.

<Trigger>When he arrived</Trigger>, he found Emily with the child upon her lap. She was endeavouring to assuage the violence of his distress for the loss of his unfortunate parent. She had moderated his transports, and was amusing him with an inimitable skill and a playful tenderness, to which her humanity and her beauty added new lustre and excited fresh emotions in the heart of Bruce. He sat down near her: <Dia>"How soon do you leave us ? Tell me, I intreat you, what course I shall take to see you as often as I have lately done, for I find I cannot live without you."</Dia> -— Emily looked at him, and smiled: <Dia>"Any friend of Lady Hyndley's must be dear to me; and, after the treatment I received from her, I cannot but be disposed to liften to the addresses and protestations of her favourite."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Your reply is a severe one; why is a regard for Lady H. more criminal than a partiality for Sir Harry?"</Dia> Emily was struck with conscious impropriety of her own conduct: Bruce proceeded - <DiaQ>"However circumstances may have appeared to injure your character, and however malignantly they may have been interpreted, I cannot be prejudiced against you; I have still the highest opinion of your virtues and your discretion. Sir Harry is now dead, and you may want the service of one who makes it his glory to be faithful in his attachments. If you smile at mv enthusiasm, at least you may approve my adoration of you. When I forfeit my allegiance to my friends, may I become unworthy <i>your</i> tenderness; no greater curse can befal me."</DiaQ> -- <Dia>"It is an odd season to talk of love, nor ought I to hear you on a subject so foreign to my present situation; I have, indeed, lost such a friend, that it is, perhaps, my duty never to allow another a place in my heart."</Dia> --- <Dia>"As a lover, Madam, Sir Harry was, no doubt, happy."</Dia> -- <Dia>"You err most cruelly, he was no lover, he was merely a friend; it ill becomes you, Sir, to draw such constructions from that sacred name; you injure his memory, and insult my character, if you think I was the companion of his pleasures; Sir Harry's views were noble, he would not for the world -——"</Dia> <Dia>"Nay, Madam, after what we have this day seen, Sir Harry's virtues will hardly be brought even into question; the wretch who could subvert the principles, ruin the fame, and afterwards promote the destruction of a woman, is too depraved for me to vindicate: but I hope to be pardoned for daring to employ your time and your thoughts on so worthless an object as myself; I want neither ardour, sincerity, nor perseverance, but I stand in great need of interest in your heart; I have indeed foolishly thought, as you ostentatiously declined the idea of a sordid partiality to any admirer, that my adoration might be favourably accepted; you know me for your friend, your servant, and your lover."</Dia> -——

As he pronounced these words very emphatically, <ArrivalDeparture>Lady Hyndley entered the room</ArrivalDeparture>; she appeared highly enraged, and addressed Emily with a look of insolent severity: <Dia>"Since I know it, I shall take care to be so much the friend of <i>your</i> family, Madam, as not to let you throw yourself away upon a young man whose ingratitude to me proves him unworthy your affection."</Dia> Bruce was distressed at the interruption: <Dia>"If I am your ladyship's friend, I am not your slave; your influence over me is that of haughty despotism, not of insinuating tenderness; I never meant to offend you by my regard for Miss Bryant; <i>your</i> claims to my sincerest and most zealous partiality are certainly unlimited, but why may I not, in an honourable way, address my vows to a lovely woman, who may boast her empire over my heart, founded on virtue and beauty?"</Dia> Lady Hyndley grew more inflamed: <Dia>"To-morrow, Madam, I must recommend you to your family."</Dia> Bruce was stung at her illiberal use of power: <Dia>"And to-morrow I shall return to Oxford."</Dia> Lady Hyndley retired without a reply. Emily, who would not appear to be sensible of her rudeness, told Bruce that she had written to Lady Bryant, and should have the carriage sent the next morning: <Dia>"My heart is so completely wrung by the gloomy events of these three days, that I shall hardly ever recover that airy mirth which has blessed me in every period of my life. I shall resign myself to sorrow and reflection, and endeavour to retire to the country, where no sounds or sights of pleasure can interrupt my melancholy. I confess to you, my tears will ever flow for the loss of poor Sir Harry; why I so much respect his memory, and why my heart melts into the utmost softness of sorrow at the recollection of him, I know not, unless it is the sense of his unbounded generosity. Think not unfavourably of me for having loved him; I have often told you it was friendship not passion."</Dia>

Bruce repeated his own ardent protestations: <Dia>"I must cease to hear you have so little regard for yourself and me, as to relinquish all in the world that is worth living for; would <i>you</i> give up society who have a mind formed for all that is great and good ?"</Dia> -— His passionate vehemence affeced her; she felt returning fondness glide into her soul; and she at last allowed him to vow eternal bondage to her, and to seal it with a kiss upon her hand. —- At that instant the miniature of Sir Harry, which hung at her watch, fell to the ground, and broke. Bruce took it up, and saw her relapsing to her former uncertainty: <Dia>"Can an event so trifling, Madam, have the power of refuting my sincerity?"</Dia> —— Emily gazed on the piture without replying; at last she turned to Bruce, and, with a composed air, asked him, <DiaQ>"What can make me amends for the loss of such a friend and the injury to such a picture? You cannot answer me - I'll tell you then; let me find in Bruce the man of honour, the tender friend, and the discreet companion, and I shall always estimate his regard as a compensation for every loss and every sorrow."</DiaQ> Bruce with great delight acknowledged her goodness.

<Blend>They now retired</Blend>, <ArrivalDeparture>Miss Bryant to her own apartment</ArrivalDeparture>, and Bruce to Lady Hyndley, whom he found pouting with the sullen discontent of neglected vanity. He turned the conversation on young Forrester, the child of whom he had threatened to undertake the care, if her ladyship cast him off. She spoke of him with acrimony: <Dia>"Do you think it right, George, that this urchin should be a charge upon me? he will never repay me in any way for the generosity I may shew him."</Dia> -— <Dia>"Therefore your ladyship seems inclined to keep him clear of ingratitude by never behaveing towards him with common charity."</Dia> -- <Dia>"I wish he was taken away, I cannot bear him, he puts me so much in mind of poor Sir Harry."</Dia> --- <Dia>"Much as your ladyship hated your husband, I did not think you carried your antipathy so far as to detest the recollection of his image."</Dia> -- <Dia>"How impertinent you are, George - but I shall dismiss the boy."</Dia> —— <Dia>"I am sure you cannot be so cruel; he is a fine little rogue; let us send him."</Dia> —— <Dia>"I won't - I will not see him."</Dia> —- Bruce rung the bell, and the child was brought into the room; Lady Hyndley arose, and was going away, but Miss Bryant came in, and Bruce joined her in prevailing upon her ladyship to stay. The child sat for some time, but without speaking; at last Bruce called him: <Dia>"How should you like to go away from here, and leave us ?"</Dia> The boy lifted up his eyes, and, looking earnestly at Lady Hyndley, he went up to her, and, laying his hand on her knee, <DiaQ>"I don't like to leave such a pretty lady as this."</DiaQ> The speech operated like electricity upon the <i>generous</i>, the "<i>beneficent</i> Lady Hyndley; she took the child in her arms, and kissed him with rapture: <Dia>"Don't fear, my sweet little one, you never shall leave me, I'll take care of you as long as I live - he is a charming fine fellow, George; what eyes he has, and this chin is quite Sir Harry's! - Ah ! I shall love him for poor Sir Harry's sake - what have you had for dinner today, my dear! - poor thing! he looks as if he had not eat this week; do ring the bell, George, let us have tea, and give him something. Come, my little rogue, you shall sit in my lap, and I'll always be your friend, and you will be my little companion."</Dia>

The excessive fondness which Lady Hyndley lavished on the child was scarcely credible even to those who beheld it. One of the greatest masters of the human heart has said, <QuotedLit><i>Nous sommes si accoutumés a nous deguiser aux autres, qu'à la fin nous nous deguisons à nous mêmes.</i></QuotedLit></SceneDia>

<SceneDia>The next day, previous to Emily's departure, Bruce intreated her to let him accompany her to Sir Edward Bryant's. She would not hear of it: <Dia>"Never, till you have every right over me which my hand can give you, shall you be seen by my family; if they receive you as a man of honour and a man of fortune, they will take care to know that their expectations are well-founded, and I shall have no opportunity of truusting to the purity of your principles or to the ardour of your passion. You will be the choice of my friends, not the choice of my heart; and I shall be considered as a mere wife, who has a right to every pleasure and respect that you can give me. I shall be obliged to advance a claim where I cannot prove a welcome in your mind, and shall become no more than your rector, to take tythes of all you possess and reside in the parsonage house. This will render you and myself unworthy in my own eyes: when I cease to share your affection I will cease to deserve it; and when I cease to deserve it, I will cease to claim it. While I am your friend I will treat you with the sincerity of a wife; if I am your wife I will treat you with the tenderness of a friend, and thus endeavour to exalt the characer of both."</Dia>

Bruce was delighted with her frankness and her resolution: he endeavoured to persuade her to marry him instantly, but she steadily refused: <Dia>"I owe respectful behaviour to my friends, and that is all - but I owe much more to myself. Rectitude, propriety, and discretion, are to be consulted; they are <i>my</i> guardians, and I shall never marry without their consent <i>first had and obtained</i>."</Dia> Bruce smiled: <Dia>"You have read <i>Detouches</i>, Madam?"</Dia>

<DiaTheater><i>Emily</i>. Certainly.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>B</i>. Do you remember his <i>Triple Marriage</i>? It is a very good piece; Isabelle there says to Nérine of her lover, "Je lui ai juré de n'epouser jamais que lui." To which Nérine replies, "Ma foi, Mademoiselle, il y a long temps que l'amour et le marriage ont fait divorce, et qu'ils ont juré de n'habiter plus ensemble; je compte plus sur leurs serments que sur les votres."</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Emily</i>. You are very severe in your application; but it is no new thing for young men to be more humorous than tender. Your vanity, in supposing I should break an oath because I am sincere, has led you into a most capricious inference which no reason can juflify. I find I must learn to be less communicative. Now, therefore, we are quits. You have amply repaid my plain dealing, by the severe lesson you teach me to keep every pretended admirer at his proper distance. I make you a low courtesy for your excellent precept, and beg I may not fee you often.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>B</i>. Every hour of --</DiaTheater> 

<DiaTheater><i>Emily</i>. That I may be able to put it in practice - for, to adhere rigidly to your doctrine, I ought never to see you again.</DiaTheater>

Emily was retiring, but Bruce recanted with so much pleasantry and ardour, that being now invested with the dignity of her serious lover, he <i>took the oaths and his seat in her heart</i>.</SceneDia>

The resolution of Emily not to admit Bruce at Sir Edward's left him in a state of indeterminate anxiety. He could not bear her absence. She had told him that she should go for a few days to pay a visit in the country to one of her friends, Mrs. Ellyson. He was earnest to shew some new proof of his attachment, but he declined mentioning his intentions to Miss Bryant. He had informed her that he must return to Oxford the next morning, and he now repeated his declaration, adding, that he should fondly hope for a speedy interview with her, perhaps at Lady Hyndley's. On the ensuing day they parted; Miss Eryant returned to Sir Edward's, and in the evening set off to <Cryptonym>K</Cryptonym>, Mrs. Ellyson's house in the country.

Previous to Emily's departure, she again exerted her natural benevolence. To Lady Hyndley she presented very valuable and elegant gifts, which she had bespoken for that purpose some time before. Her ladyship could hardly endure the acceptance of them, but the graceful charm with which Emily offered them, overcame her ladyship's aversion. To little Forrester, the new acquaintance at this house, who had been well educated in the days of his mother's prosperity, she gave some proper donations, which were handsome testimonies to his merit. Her ladyship and the whole family were astonished at her profusion and generosity: <SpeechInsert>"Why do you do this, Miss Bryant? What claims have we in <i>your</i> opinion to the effusions of a liberality, which leads you to lavish these presents with such noble prodigality?"</SpeechInsert> -- <SpeechInsert>"My respect, Madam, rather let me say my esteem, my affecion for the memory of Sir Harry, (and let me declare it without offending your ladyship) will induce me, through my life, to behave to his friends and relations with solicitous endearment: my tears will ever stream at remembering the wretched termination of his existence, and my heart will ever glow with gratitude at the recollection of the disinterested partiality by which he attached me to his interests. He was a munificent benefacor, prodigal in his bounties to me; accepted by all my family as one of my first friends; authorised by their most unlimited regard, and deserving every encomium from me by the strength and the perpetuity of his kindness: these are motives to gratitude; but my heart seems to tell me, that even had he never been so partial to me, I must yet have loved him with tnederness and with propriety, with invariable innocence and unequalled fervour."</SpeechInsert>

Lady Hyndley said no more; the gifts of Emily softened her antipathy, and the manner in which she now addressed her had such an appearance of sincerity, that she could not help hoping she spoke truth. The servants, Miss Bryant, rewarded for their attention to her with the same dignity of beneficence ; and, when she quitted Lady Hyndley's house, carried with her the blessings and the admiration of every inmate.

Bruce took his leave, for a short time, of Lady Hyndley; he recommended the child once more in a very pathetic manner, and promised her ladyship to revisit London shortly. He then departed, as she imagined, to Oxford, but really to the house of a friend, who assisted him in an important undertaking he had in view.

Bruce had been enamoured of many women yet had never before been sensible to a solid attachment. The dangers to which he was liable, from being discovered by Lady Hyndley, lost all their terror on the present occcasion; and it was only his fear of being known to the friends of Emily, that urged him to seek the shelter of a disguise, by means of which he could remain concealed, and at the same time enjoy frequently the company of Miss Bryant. Love, the creator of all artifice, at last suggested to him the disguise of a footman, in which character he determined to offer his services to Sir Edward Bryant, who had discharged one a few days before. None of the family knew him; Emily would, doubtless, for her own sake, assist the deception; and no difficulty occurred but the want of a recommendation from some former master. He immediately applied to his friend <ChNameIntro>Orford</ChNameIntro>, who had been a partner with him in many airy frolics. The proposal charmed a young man of less invention and of as much gaiety as Bruce. He sat down instantly, wrote a long letter to Sir Edward, and another to Lady Bryant, wherein he strained every epithet to exalt his friend's talents for the office he wished to fill: he repeated the most ardent declarations of that regard which he had so often professed for the family, and as a proof, recommended to them <FID>an excellent young man, the bearer, who was <FIDitalics><i>formed to serve them</i></FIDitalics></FID>.

<ChPortraitIntro>Colonel Orford was one of the most dissipated characters that blazed in the circles of fashionable splendour; yet he was a libertine, not from inclination but, from youthful vanity and habitual excess. He natually abhorred dissipation of every kind, yet a false disdain of domestic virtues and rational amusements had plunged him into an early course of unceasing debauchery. He was often drunk, though he detested wine: he kept a mistress, to whose charms he was not insensible; but the dread of being thought constant, even to her, had frequently united him to the most elegant in high life and to the most despicable in the lower class of unfortunate women. He gamed deep; and, as he won without pleasure, he lost without anger. The brilliancy of his dress, the politeness of his manners, and the magnificence of his equipage, had secured him a place in the exalted circles, which are often ignorantly censured by those who cannot approach them, without being sicerely applauded by those who can.</ChPortraitIntro>

Such was the assistant of Bruce in his present undertaking. A plain suit of cloaths being provided, he waited on Lady Bryant; and, after a few interrogations, was ordered to come to his place the next day.

Bruce's romantic disposition was every way gratified in the pursuit of this scheme. He was wrapped in the contemplation of his approaching triumph all the way to Colonel Orford's, and as he went along, ran against three posts, jostled a couple of porters, and overset an old lady, in the <QuotedLit>"cogibundity of his cogitations."</QuotedLit> He anticipated all those events which are governed by improbability, and foresaw the issue of every circumstance, and the train of every success, which <i>could not</i> possibly happen. <MonologueThought>"While I am in the humble situation which awaits me, I shall not only indulge my enthuiasm in the cause of love but my raptures also in the service of friendship: I shall superadd, to the glory of gaining my mistress, the satisfaction of making new friends, a business which does honour to the man of benevolence and the man of the world. These friends too, whom I gain in an humble station, will be of the noblest kind. They will be faithful and disinterested; I shall have the best opportunity of trying their zeal and of proving their steadiness. Thus forming intimacies, as no man ever did before, I shall not be indebted to sordid views for <i>their</i> attachment to me. The world will now learn, that there still exists, in its full vigour, and in its most splendid colours, the lofty sentiment of generous regard; and how much I have deserved esteem will be manifest by my success in securing it."</MonologueThought> These were the self-complacent reflecions of Bruce, as he left Lady Bryant's. In the same strain of wild imagination he raised ideal and indissoluble fabrics of friendship in his conversation with Orford, who smiled at his oddity and pitied his inexperience. Bruce, like a true Quixote, listened to no objections against the indulgence of his sanguine hopes; in his defence, <AuthorWe>we</AuthorWe> may remember that Crebillon
has said, <QuotedLit>"Les leçons et les examples sont peu de choses pour un jeune homme, et ce n'est jamais qu'à ses depens qu'il s'instruit*."</QuotedLit><Footnote>*Les Egaremens du Coeur et de l'Esprit.</Footnote>

When Bruce arose the next morning, and prepared for his departure, Orford informed him, that he had the day before called at Lady Hyndley's; that she was going to set off for the country without delay; that she intended to write a letter to Bruce as soon as she arrived there, and that she had, the day he called, sent young Forrester to a school at some distance from town, where, however, she did not intend he should remain, as he was grown so fond of the child, it was impossible to part with him. She extolled him to the Colonel with unwearied praise: <SpeechInsert>"He is so pretty; he has so many winning ways, and above all, though so young a child, he has the sense, Colonel, to enter deep into my character, for he never thinks of me but kindly; and he lisps his dear little praises so naturally ! - he is a charming child; and if he goes on as well as he promises, we may hope from him every thing great and good."</SpeechInsert>

Bruce departed, and arrived at Sir Edward Bryant's. His first object was to inquire after his Emily; he was informed that she was gone to K. the residence of her friend Mrs. Ellyson and was to return very soon. He then inquired into the characters of the family; and, cultivating an

#75#

intimacy with Lewston, who was woman to Lady Bryant, he obtained the following information.

Sir Edward was a characer not often seen. He was very facetious. Ever ready to be entertained by his friends, and contributed largely to their merriment: but he had a most dangerous talent; his love of ridicule was not professed. Disguised by a perpetual appearance of kindness, no one suspected that his great aim, in the cultivation of his friendihips, was to exhibit, with treacherous skill, those deformities which disfigure the surface of every character in a greater or less degree. He had the art of soothing every body's failings, and extolling their absurdities, that he might obtain the <ItalicsOther><i>full length</i></ItalicsOther> of every folly, out of which he drew a fund of humour for the amusement of the table. These perfidious blandishments were often happily exerted upon the most wise and the most gigantic minds, for as they were conscious of their own powers, they little suspected any one watched their intellectual blemishes with a daring and satirical merriment. Sir Edward had many friends and an unbounded acquaintance. A smooth address, a polished behaviour, and a countenance, which had been <ItalicsOther><i>drilled</i></ItalicsOther> at his entrance into life, and, exercised in all the <ItalicsOther><i>evolutions</i></ItalicsOther> of attractive pleasantry and amiable benignity, fascinated those who were exposed to the derision of the spectators by his insidious mirth. He was a convivial basilisk, who attraced only to destroy.

Lady Bryant was an elegant woman. Her dress was the great objet of her affections, and so powerfully was she attached to the Deity of fashion, that every passion and foible was concentred in perpetual obedience to his dictates. Of such a woman <AuthorI>I</AuthorI> shall not now say much; she is a common charater, but not to be despised for these propensities. <Sententia>Whoever renders themselves and the world more agreeable than they were are entitled to a very great portion of popular applause.</Sententia>

Emily and a son were the descendants of this family. Mr. Bryant had his mother's fondness for splendour, without his father's admiration for wit. He was very polite, for he would always laugh at a jest without requiring it to be explained, a condescension which often laid the relater under some obligation. Mr. EByant's mouth was indeed perpetually <ItalicsOther>"<i>ajar</i>."</ItalicsOther> He was perfectly good-natured. He would, at the cost of others, eat with anybody, drink with anybody, game with anybody, and do any thing with anybody. His constitution would have been early sacrificed to his facility of temper, and his estate, perhaps, spent before he came to it, but one trait in his disposition carried an antidote to all ruinous excesses; for, of his friends, no one accused him of that pernicious brilliancy of expence or those powers of entertainment, which allure and enchain a company to the utter ruin of their possessor. Mr. Bryant was therefore only invited when he was thought of. The young men of spirit found him too penurious, and the young men of gaiety too dull, for their society. His chief associates were the <i>mere</i> women of fashion, whose insipid minds established a reciprocal security from every possible danger. With all this, his friend Temple declared, that Mr. Bryant once said a <CharacterDiction><i>good thing</i></CharacterDiction>; for, to the astonishment of every one - he said grace at dinner.

<SceneDia>On the ensuing morning, Bruce and another servant attended Lady Bryant to pay visits. The first house they went to was an ill omen for Bruce. They stopped at Mrs. Sydney's, who was one of Bruce's most intimate friends, a woman from whom he had received many favours, and whose assistance he had some thoughts of soliciting on the subject of Miss Eryant. Mrs. Sydney had a large fortune, and was rather advanced in years. Among many good qualities, which rendered her truly amiable, she was principally beloved for her excessive zeal in promoting the happiness of young people, without patronizing their vices. She often inveighed against the cruelty and oppression with which the old rule the young, descanted very largely upon the envious jealousy with which they denied pleafures to youth, because they themselves were unable to partake of them. She frequently declared, that her mind should never be out of its <FIDitalics><i>teens</i></FIDitalics>; that she looked upon herself as bound in duty, for the honour of <FIDitalics><i>age</i></FIDitalics>, to shew the world that some people might be <FIDitalics><i>old</i></FIDitalics> and <FIDitalics><i>human</i></FIDitalics> at the same time, and to prove to them that there was not so much disgrace in a second childhood, provided the last infancy was nourished by the <FIDitalics><QuotedLit><DoxaQuotes><i>milk of human kindness</i></DoxaQuotes></QuotedLit></FIDitalics>. Such a woman was a proper person for Bruce to apply to in his late exigency; but the present scheme had rendered it unnecessary. Lady Bryant stayed but a short time, and then drove to Lady Warynton's, where, while the servants waited, Lord <Cryptonym>W.</Cryptonym> came out. <Trigger>He looked at Bruce with some earnestness</Trigger>, and then asked him if he was not the new servant lately come from Col. Orford to Lady Bryant? Bruce replied in the affirmative; and Lord W. desiring to speak to him, he followed to the dressing-room; where, cautiously shutting the door, Lord W. began.

<DiaTheater><i>Ld. W.</i> My honest friend, I have heard such an account of your skill and fidelity from your late master, who would never, I assure you, have parted with you but to oblige Sir Edward Bryant, that I am induced to rely upon your kindness and conduct in an affair of great importance. If I find I can depend upon you, promise yourself every recompence my generosity can the flow, for, I never refute to pay well, if I am served with integrity.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> The report of your lordship's liberality is not new to me. Fame has almost done justice to your high ideas and to your perpetual display of true nobility; I shall think myself gratified in the opportunity of shewing my respect for your charater. To the sacred and so often abused title of <i>friend</i>, I can never hope to lay claim; it will be enough for me to possess the luxury of reflecting what an amicable sincerity might have been interwoven between our minds, had we been born equal.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Ld. W.</i> Upon my word, you speak incomparably, for a fellow in your station. Where did you come from? I fancy you must have received a decent education.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> The great lesson, my lord, which I have learned, has been to make myself useful. To cultivate the seeds of activity, fidelity, and attachment, which I early discovered in my own heart. A young lad, who has to make his way in the world, needs every requisite of diligence and prudence. I wish I could add to the present little stock of merit, which your lordship is pleased to estimate so highly, the pleasure of serving you in any undertaking with zeal and readiness.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Ld. W.</i> You astonish me! why you are just the person I wanted. - But I am so overwhelmed with surprise at your elevated sentiments, and the propriety of your address, that I can scarcely believe what I hear.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> I am sorry for that, my lord, for I speak sincerely.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Ld. W.</i> I do not doubt it; but I mean, 'tis melancholy for you to be in such a situation as yout present one, with the abilities which you possess.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> I prefer my present situation to all others, my lord. I see the world; I have little trouble; and while I am treated with kindness, I shall never regret the prosperity which I see others in possession of. I am under many obligations to fortune; for, instead of giving me a mass of wealth, she has bestowed upon me the means of enjoyment.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Ld. W.</i> And a philosopher too ! This is the most extraordinary instance of fortune's caprice that I ever beheld - but we have not now time to inquire about it. I see you have every excellence that I can wish for, and therefore I scruple not to tell you, you may look upon me as your friend. Here is a letter which I wish to have conveyed with all possible care, speed, and secrecy, to the place of its address. I hope you know your business, your interest, and my power to serve you, too well to betray me. I am equally amazed and delighted at your discourse; and, when I have more leisure, shall be very glad to hear your history, and to know if I can render you any solid service. In the mean time, there are five guineas, as a pledge of my future favour.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> No, my lord, you must excuse me if I decline your generous offer. I am a perfect stranger to you, and you cannot tell of what value or unimportance may be my endeavours to acquit myself to your satisfaction. I will not abuse your bounty, by receiving a donation before I have deserved it. When I have executed your commission, and you have reason to commend me, I shall think myself amply recompenfed by the honour of your praises.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Ld. W.</i> By Heaven, you're a noble fellow ! Well, my good friend, I am almost ashamed of not having paid a worthier tribute to your merit, in a more decent way. I sincerely beg your pardon, and shall seek an opportunity to make amends for my deficiency. There is the letter; it is for Miss Meredyth; she lives in <Cryptonym>* * Street</Cryptonym>, Portman Square. If you can contrive to leave it before six, and bring me an answer, your whole commission will be fully executed; and I'll meet you at night at Mrs. Ruelle's in Dover Street.</DiaTheater>

Lady Bryant's carriage was now called; Bruce therefore quitted the room and soon after went away with her ladyship.</SceneDia> They reached Sir Edward's before four, and Bruce was then luckily dispatched with some notes to that part of the town where Miss Meredyth resided. <SceneDia>He went to the house; and, after waiting some time for an answer to Lord W.'s letter, he was ordered to come up stairs. A servant shewed him into a room where Miss Meredyth sat. She was a most beautiful woman, of five and twenty, elegantly dressed; and in her eyes were blended such a mixture of vivacity and tenderness, that their power was irresistible: <Dia>"Do you live with Lord Warynton ?"</Dia>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> No, Madam, I live with Sir Edward Bryant; but have the honour of being employed by Lord Warynton on this occasion.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> You was ordered to wait for an answer ?</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> Certainly, Madam. I presume you are too well acquainted with the impatient disposition of Lord Warynton not to suppose that he ordered me to wait.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> Bless me ! he had more sense than to mention the contents of his silly letter to any body, I hope ?</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> Upon no account, Madam - upon no account in the world - for it was impossible that any body could guess them.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> I fancy you would smile now, if you dared; and truly I could not blame you. I suppose you are his confident?</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> I dare not boast so much, Madam; for I have not earned his unlimited frankness.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> Is this the first embassy of the kind in which he has employed you?</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> Upon my honour it is - and perhaps, Madam, it will be the last.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> I hope so, for his own sake. There is an answer, it is very short - but it is the last I shall write.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> May I presume to request, Madam, that the answer shall be such as will afford him some pleasure ? I should be very unwilling to be the messenger of unpleasing news.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> How, are you interested in it?</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> No further than as I am influenced by my very great respect for Lord Warynton.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> I never desire to hear any thing about Lord Warynton; and I should think myself indebted to you, if you would for the future decline bringing me any letters or messages from him.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> I never before, Madam, was so cruelly situated. His lordship's kindness to me has been so great, I think myself every way obliged to exert myself in his service; and, I confess, till now never thought it difficult to obey him. Permit me to say, that when he gave me the billet, which I just brought, it was with an air of so much truth and tenderness, that I did not doubt his success, in whatever it contained, before I saw you - and still less afterwards.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> You plead his cause very well. Who taught you to speak so much above your station? You must have had an able teacher.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> Indeed I had, Madam; but names are sacred. I shall have a much higher opinion both of the instructor and the pupil, if I can prevail upon you to send his lordship a gentle answer.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> Who are you ? Have you lived long with Sir Edward ?</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> Two days, Madam.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> Your history must be interesting. I wonder by what strange fatality you have been so misplaced in the world. To a person of your sagacity, such a situation must be truly mortifying. Have you no prospect of raising yourself to a more eligible rank?</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> Why should I, Madam? That post, which gives me the opportunity of access to so lovely a woman as Miss Meredyth, can have no circumstances, however disagreeable, which are not easily borne. But, the truth is, that the condition of a lacquais has ten thousand advantages which I may say our superiors never attain to. In the first place, we are often at the tables of the great; and some among us have the ear of the leading men in this country.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> What, the men of fashion ?</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> No, Ma'am, those are the <i>led</i> men; I mean the men in power - But, I beg pardon, I should have mentioned first, a much more important advantage - we are always near the ladies, the contemplation of whose beauty mitigates many difficulties and many sorrows.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> I ihould rather imagine you must be frequenty mortified, if you have the sensibility to be touched by beauties, which you can never possess.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> Pardon me, Madam; there are some women whose portraits are inimitably fine, but who are obscured by a want of interest in the countenance - there are others indeed</DiaTheater> - Here he sighed, and looked on the ground; Miss Meredyth replied, <DiaQ>"Well, what of those others? How do they differ?</DiaQ>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> In the radiance which their minds communicate to their eyes, and that delightful illumination and intelligence which are diffused through their countenances.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> Then the sex seems to be divided between light and shade.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> I never presume, Madam, to judge decisively. I am too young, and ought to be too diffident of my own discernment, to form an opinion, which a glance from a beautiful woman may destroy in an instant.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> And, do you never venture to form any opinion of the sex, then ?</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> Yes, Madam, one invariable decision - that they can be judged of by no general rule.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> This is rude, Sir - your good sense might have taught you better, and your good manners should have deterred you from giving a verdict you cannot support. Your vanity has been excited by some unexpected, perhaps some unmerited honour; and you suffer a vanity, which might be turned to your advantage, to be misled by your spleen.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> Spleen, Madam, I have none - Vanity I have much, and I never found it dangerously gratified till now. Your solicitude to hear my opinion made you forget the inconvenience of sincerity. I will make any apologies for daring to be ingenuous and must submit to your severe censure of my inability to deceive you.</DiaTheater>

Bruce here made a very graceful bow, and was retiring, when Miss Meredyth, with a blush, called him back.

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> I beg your pardon for what I said, and for seeming more interested in your story than it was possible I could be. If my respect for Lord Warynton led me to be candid to his ambassador, I may escape reproof without the charge even of impropriety.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> You charm ne, Madam, by your good opinion of his lordship; and I shall take particular care to convince him how sensible you are of his merit. He will be delighted at the success of my embassy, since I have obtained for him - what I could not procure for myself - your good opinion.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> Nay, nay - do not run away in an error and mislead your employer - I never intend to see Lord Warynton; and, I request you, if he asks your opinion on the probability of his success, that you will tell him so. You seem not to be acquainted with either my situation in life or my principles of action. I am a woman born to be swayed by passion and prepossession. The tenderest and the softest impulse of the heart is mingled with all my ideas of pleasure and plans of happiness. Fond and luxurious, I have yet neither injustice nor arrogance: it is my error to yield to the first emotions excited by love and to acknowledge an impression even from an inferior - but I will never sacrifice myself to the importunity of those who have higher duties and superior claims.</DiaTheater>

A soft effusion upon her cheeks, excited by a mixture of shame and passion, conferred new beauty upon the charms of Miss Meredyth; she walked to the window, and Bruce, who was never at a loss, replied immediately:

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> You honour me, Madam, by your noble frankness, which I, so much your in- ferior, have no right to expect. I applaud that spirit of integrity and independence which enables you to pursue your own pleasure, without being gratified at the expence of your equity, or the peace of others. What shall I say to Lord Warynton ? Will he not suspect me of neglecting the charge I have received? I fear I shall incur his resentment.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> You ought, for you see his lordship has the gallantry to be in fear of incurring mine.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> I feel your reproach very sensibly - but I dare not be my own interpreter, and still more I fear to be your's.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Miss M.</i> These fears may increase, and I never wish to be the cause of such unpleasing sensations. The whimsical pride of hiding your penetration ill suits with the high ideas that might be formed of your generosity at first seeing you. I am sorry that I have so far forgot what is due to you, and what is due to myself. You could hardly, therefore, wonder if I hinted to you, that no message from Lord Warynton can be agreeable to me, and that his messengers must have politeness and good sense, at least equal to your perverseness, before I can receive them with friendly confidence.</DiaTheater>

<DiaTheater><i>Br.</i> I can bear any evil, Madam, but your displeasure.</DiaTheater>

A servant now entered the room and announced Mr. Aigrette the jeweller: <DiaM>"Tell him," <M>said Miss M.</M> "that I am engaged at present, but that I will send to him to-day."</DiaM>

The servant retired. Miss Meredyth paused a few minutes, and then unlocking a drawer, took out a fausse-montre: <Dia>"In your way home, oblige me by leaving this at Aigrette's; he is to return a casket, which I shall thank you for bringing to me any time to-morrow, but deliver it into no hands except my own."</Dia> Bruce readily prorifed to obey her; he asked if she had any further commands: <DiaM>"I have no right to command," <M>replied Miss Meredyth</M>, "where neither condescension nor influence are acknowledged. You boast of being a servant to Lord Warynton as well as to Sir Edward Bryant, and who would quit the service or the interest of two such men ?"</DiaM> - <Dia>"How am I to understand you, Madam ?"</Dia> - <Dia>"You are in great haste ! - but, however, let me see you to-morrow."</Dia> - <Blend>Bruce added a final obeisance and withdrew</Blend>. <MonologueThought>"What a singular woman !" <M>he reflected as he returned from her:</M> "She is exquisitely beautiful ! I believe, (Emily forgive me!) I believe I sighed - did I sigh ? - and if I did, what then ? I am too much attached to Emily to suspect myself - but I am to call again to-morrow - to what end ? She is very pretty - but what is that to me - I am only plenipo from Lord Warynton - but then I have declined all mercenary advantages, and in love I ought to do so - I'll ask Miss Meredyth's opinion of it - she may perhaps recompense my fidelity and disinterestedness - and it should be requited with something more than praise. How I wander, but - <QuotedLit>'L'amour n'est qu'illusion; il se fait pour ainsi dire un autre univers ; ii s'entoure d'objets qui ne sont point, ou auxquels lui seul a donné l'être : et comme il rend tous ses sentimens en images, son langage est toujours figuré.'</QuotedLit>ROUSSEAU, Heloise."</MonologueThought></SceneDia>
