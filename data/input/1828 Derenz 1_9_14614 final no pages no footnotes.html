<ChapMarker>CHAPTER I.</ChapMarker>

<SceneAction>The evening was cold, and wild, and dark, and yet the Lady Sabina, with her little baby pressed to her bosom, continued walking backward and forward on the balcony of her tower. Her garments, of yellow, fluttering on the blast, and her long hair floating in ringlets of auburn over her white arms.

Sometimes she would start as the shrill trumpet proclaimed some martial order. Sometimes she would stop to contemplate the desolation which war had caused in the fertile plains around, -— and gazing on the grey walls and baronial splendour of the castle, whose proud banners still waved with the triumph of victory, and whose frowning battlements, fortified walls, and well-constructed drawbridge, had only just resisted a formidable attack from the enemy, she would sigh at the recollection of those domestic contentions which too much prevailed in the early annals of her beloved country.

But regrets and feelings Of a more interesting nature pressed heavily on the heart of the Lady Sabina; and, as her little baby smilingly looked up in her face, a tear fell on the rosy cheek of the lovely cherub, whom she fondly pressed to her bosom.

At this moment a young female appeared on the balcony, peeping through the profusion of dark hair, which covered her over like a veil.

<DiaM>"The night is falling fast, Sabina," <M>said the fair Mariot</M>, "and 'tis too cold for my pretty Ardan," <M>she added, snatching him from his mother's arms, and kissing him</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Why, Patrick," <M>she continued, turning to an old soldier who was just passing</M>, "you have had sad work this time past —- were the enemy numerous?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Indeed, and they were numerous, lady," <M>replied Patrick</M>, "and only for Master Conrad we'd all have been badly off. Ah! he's a true Milesian."</DiaM> And, as Patrick spoke, he flung his Cran Tubal over his shoulder, and slowly pursued his way.</SceneAction>

The Lady Sabina and Mariot were daughters to an old Irish knight.

A sad and dark destiny hung over the fate of the Lady Sabina, (the recital of which we must defer at the present moment,) but Mariot was happy as youth, health, and innocence could make her. <ScenePerception>After a long absence, commenced in childhood and devoted to education, she had only just returned to the castle of her ancestors, and as she raised her window, the morning after her arrival, and looked at the wide-spreading sea sparkling in the sunbeam, the fresh woods, the blue mountains, the azure sky, the dark cypress and cedar, contrasted with the light willow and mountain-ash, waving lightly and gracefully their pliant branches in the breeze, her heart arose to her Creator, and she pitied the inhabitants of a city who were deprived of such powerful incentives to devotion.</ScenePerception>

<SceneFragment>The family of the castle had now assembled to partake of their evening repast, which consisted of kneaded cakes, with honey diluted in water, served up in golden cups; and, as Mariot handed a cup of the beverage to the old Irish knight, she said, in her expressive native language, <DiaQ>"Dear father, will you not take me to-morrow to see the Abbey of St. Bernard? oh! I was delighted yesterday evening, as Conrad and I sat on the rocks, the towers, and battlements of the monastery, rising so beautifully over the dark woods; and the hymn of the Monks! really you could scarcely believe we could hear it at such a distance."</DiaQ> -— <DiaM>"You are anxious to see the royal Monk, I suppose," <M>said Conrad</M></DiaM>. <DiaM>"In truth, I am," <M>replied Mariot</M>; "his story interests me so much. Oh! dear, to think of the young and graceful Prince of Connaught resigning the splendour of his father's court for the gloomy scenes of a cloister."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Unfortunate Prince of Connaught!" <M>exclaimed an old melancholy looking man who sat leaning on his elbow, absorbed in deep thought</M>. "Oh! unfortunate youth! but who will presume," <M>he added, turning to the old knight, (Mac Morni,)</M> "who will presume to say that the Lady Una was not guilty? who will presume to say that my loved, my lovely Ethne—"</DiaM>

Here the old man burst into tears and <ArrivalDeparture>hastily left the room</ArrivalDeparture>, and with much interest they all continued talking on the subject, till the deep-toned castle bell echoed through the long gallery; and Mariot, impressed with sadness by the singular and sorrowful story she had just heard, sat for a length of time by the pale, cold moon-beam, her hands folded across her bosom, and her heart absorbed in sympathetic tenderness, for the interesting old Lorcan</SceneFragment>; and when she did attempt to sleep, the lovely Ethne, imploring mercy from the barbarous Lady Una, mingled with the visions of the night, and the piercing shriek of the sweet baby, as it tumbled headlong down the dreadful precipice, awoke her, and, rising at an early hour, she hastened to the cliffs, to endeavour to renovate, by the balmy breeze, a frame enfeebled by such frightful dreams.

<SceneFragment>Conrad perceiving Mariot's dejection, took up a manuscript volume of Irish poems, and endeavoured to amuse her by their wild and beautiful imagery; and while she and the Lady Sabina plied their distaff, and the gay Eva turned round her spinning-wheel, Conrad read for them an epitaph on the great hero, Conan, whose remains are deposited in a tomb by a small lake, on the high mountain of Callan, in the county of Clare. <DiaM>"I think," <M>said Mariot, with a deep sigh, as she sat attentively listening</M>; "I think I hear the wind howling over the heath which grew around the tomb of the hero. But why," <M>she added</M>, "why were the remains of so distinguished a character buried in such a wild and solitary spot?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Some domestic misfortune, perhaps," <M>replied Conrad, for his life was an eventful one</M>, "disgusted the warrior with the world, and made him wish to have his remains interred far from the haunts of men."</DiaM></SceneFragment>

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER II</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia>Next morning Mac Morni said, <DiaQ>"This is not a day for our excursion to the Abbey," <M>walking to the window to gaze on the surrounding scene</M>.</DiaQ> The waves of the Atlantic, apparently sleeping for some days, now boldly swept, in rapid succession, to the shore; while the billows, bursting in white foam among the rocks, flung their high spray over the battlements of an old tower, which, in the dark days of Spanish invasion, had been erected as a warning and guide to the wandering mariner; -— over the western horizon a crimson hue tinged the clouds; -— the rest of the scene was involved in deep shade, except where a transient sunbeam illumined the foam of a dark wave, or glanced on the white wing of the sea-mew, as it flew, with loud cry and impatient wing, to shelter from the storm.

<DiaM>"Who can that figure be," <M>eagerly said Mac Morni</M>, "endeavouring to brave the fury of this tempest?" -— "Who can she be, Murrough?" <M>he added, to an old domestic <ArrivalDeparture>who had just come in</ArrivalDeparture></M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"'Tis Bridget, the pilgrim, please your Highness," <M>added Murrough, bowing</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Bridget, the pilgrim," <M>repeated Mac Morni, and a slight pause ensued</M>. "But what of this? open the door, Murrough, instantly," <M>exclaimed the old knight, whose Irish heart and castle-gates were ever open to the wanderer</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"'Tis Bridget, the pilgrim, your highness," <M>again repeated Murrough without moving</M>.</DiaM> Mac Morni paused again. <DiaM>"Bridget, the pilgrim," <M>he repeated</M>; " Well, be it so, the unfortunate woman requires shelter at the present moment, and, on such an occasion, we are not to admit a second thought."</DiaM>

But Bridget had disappeared among the trees, and Murrough felt very happy in assuring his master it would be impossible for him to discover her. <DiaM>"She is on a pilgrimage to Lough Derg," <M>continued Murrough</M>; "the old woman is in a hurry to wash away her foul crime in that holy well, and -—"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The waters of yonder ocean could not effect it;" <M>said Lorcan, with the impressive air and manner in which he always spoke</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But the blood of <i>Christ</i> can," <M>observed Mac Morni</M>, "if she applies to it with <i>true</i> and <i>right</i> belief."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And yet, perhaps, she is innocent," <M>said Conrad</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Innocent!" <M>repeated Lorcan, clasping his hands with warmth and animation</M>, "Innocent! -— Meet the murderer on the dreary wilds of Cunnamara, his hands reeking with the blood of his victim, and then affirm that he is innocent! -— Was not the Queen of Munster at the palace the very time it happened? and did not sweet Ethne herself, leave her tower the stormiest night that ever blew from the heavens; no home to receive -— no roof to shelter her: and did not I myself -—"</DiaM>

Here Lorcan struck his hand against his forehead, and closing his eyes, remained profoundly silent; once or twice Mariot spoke to him, but he answered not, apparently lost in deep and solemn thought.</SceneDia>

<SceneAction>In a few days a complete calm had succeeded the storm; and, fenced in by the dark cliffs which overhung the wave, the late restless waters, placid and blue as the sky they reflected, seemed spread into an expanse of polished mirror. <DiaM>"And see here," said the sentimental Mariot, as she and Conrad walked over the cliffs, "see how the sea-weed, uninfluenced by the slightest breeze, hangs from those rocks in the most fantastic wreaths."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh! Conrad, Conrad," <M>called out a young female, who appeared at the moment clambering over the rocks</M>, "Oh! come here; I can never get over these rocks without your assistance."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Do go," <M>said the good-natured Mariot, hastily disengaging her arm from his</M>, "Eva may require your attendance."</DiaM>

<Backstory>The lively Eva was niece to Mac Morni, bequeathed to him by a favourite sister; she was educated with all the advantages and partiality bestowed on his own daughters.

Conrad was son to the Prince of Fingal, a tract of ancient Leinster. When a child, he was sent to be reared as a fosterling in the family of Mac Morni; and his father, on his death-bed, requested he might remain at the castle till he had arrived at the age of twenty-five, when he promised his brother-in-law, (the King of Munster) that Conrad should, at that period, join the powerful and invincible Dalgais.

In the bosom of Mariot, an attachment for Conrad had long taken place; but, with all Mariot's sweetness and amiability, pretty and interesting as she was, she had not Eva's brilliant personal attractions, and perfectly conscious of this, the gentle girl would often deeply feel the arts and coquetry which Eva so evidently used to entangle Conrad.

Soon as Eva found that Mariot and Conrad had walked over the cliffs, she threw by her harp, where she had been practising a favourite air of Conrad's, and hastily pursued them.</Backstory>

<DiaM>"I can," <M>said she</M>, "at the same time tell them that my uncle is going to the Abbey of St. Bernard, and will take us all in the canoe."</DiaM> <DiaM>"I must hurry to arrange the sails;" <M>said Conrad, as soon as she spoke; and they quickened their pace to the castle, where Conrad, after a few minutes' absence, returned, saying</M>, "The canoe was anchored by the chesnut-tree, and all things were in readiness."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Will you not come, Sabina?" <M>said Mariot</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Not to-day, dear Mariot."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Nor you, sir," <M>said Mariot, turning to Lorcan.</M></DiaM>

The old man made no answer, but, taking her hand, he looked mournfully in her face.

<DiaM>"Do come, dear sir," <M>said Mariot</M>, "it will do you good."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Do <i>me</i> good, Mariot! tell this to the wretch expiring on the rack, but never speak of good to Lorcan!"</Dia>

Mariot shuddered and hesitated, but Conrad hurrying them away, in a few minutes they were crossing the arm of the sea which washed the walls of St. Bernard's Abbey.

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER III.</ChapMarker>

Mariot, from whose remembrance all those scenes had faded, gazed with wonder at the greatness and extent of the building: its dark grey walls stretched along a vast extent of rock, and its battlements towered high above the solemn woods which waved in gloomy pomp around. The little canoe now glided softly between two projecting rocks, and Conrad hastened to assist the ladies.

<DiaM>"There is the royal Monk," <M>said Mac Morni</M>.</DiaM>

They all eagerly turned round.

In the gloomy habit of the order of St. Bernard, lay reclined on a rock, covered with sea moss, the graceful Prince of Connaught.

The moment he perceived the party, he started, and, with the air of a misanthrope, he quickly stood up, and disappeared among the rocks; and some observation of Conrad's was immediately lost in the deep sound of the Abbey bell, which always tolled on the approach of strangers.

<DiaM>"I wish to speak with the Abbot," <M>said Mac Morni, turning to Mariot</M>; "meantime you, Eva, and Conrad, can explore this fine structure, and I will join you on the beach below."</DiaM>

Conrad and the two ladies immediately walked on, and, entering a long line of arches, they again encountered the royal Monk, who, in evident embarrassment, quickened his pace as he passed them; and, after spending some time contemplating the magnificent building, Conrad, taking the hand of each of his fair companions, drew them to the edge of the cliff, and telling them, with a smile, they were given up to his protection, he anxiously assisted them down a steep winding path which descended to the sea.

They had scarcely reached the beach, when they were joined by Mac Morni, and the Abbot of St. Bernard's Abbey.

On this man's brow were stamped the traces of pride, bigotry, and oppression, while the supercilious haughtiness of his soul was but ill concealed by the air of civility with which he regarded his visitors.

<DiaM>"A storm is approaching," <M>said he</M>, "you had better return to the Abbey."</DiaM>

Mac Morni looked up at the clouds; and Mariot proposed, as she started back from the spray which a wave had flung in, to walk round to the castle. <DiaM>"It will lengthen our way," <M>she added</M>, "but I own I shrink from that angry looking ocean."</DiaM>

With their fond father, the wishes of Mariot and Sabina were ever powerful; and commencing their walk, in a short time they arrived at the castle. As they were crossing the draw-bridge, a pet eagle which Patrick held by a chain attracted their notice; and at the same moment a dog, belonging to Conrad, came jumping towards them.

<DiaM>"I trust Teague is particular in feeding those dogs well," <M>said Mac Morni</M>; "I must inquire about it. In the treatment of those animals," <M>he added</M>, "I think there is generally an error, they are either too much pampered and caressed, or too much neglected; and 'tis sinful to treat with unkindness, (neglect of course is unkindness,) any thing to which God has given life."</DiaM></SceneAction>

<SceneDia>Next evening, Mariot happened to go into her father's study; -— he was sitting leaning on his elbow on the table, -— a large and ancient looking book was placed by his side; and his countenance was expressive of anxious inquiry.

<DiaM>"I intrude, sir?" <M>said Mariot, hastily retiring</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No, my child," <M>replied Mac Morni, reaching out his hand</M>, "I am never happier than when instructing and conversing with my children; and, though your absence from me was spent under the attentive eye of an excellent aunt, I have been always jealous of the tuition that I would have wished exclusively to monopolize. This large and ancient book, my child, was given to my grandsire by St. Patrick. They met at the royal palace in Cashel; a friendship took place between them, and, when they were parting, St. Patrick presented my grandsire with this blessed book, which holy men, inspired by the Spirit of God, wrote for our instruction.

"I cannot rightly account for it, but I think the perusal of it, -— I don't know how it is," <M>continued the old knight, musing</M>, "but I don't feel as much in love with the faith of my ancestors as I was: I must read on; perhaps by persevering in the perusal I may meet with some sentiment that may set my mind at rest; but it is only on immaterial points I am puzzled," <M>added the old knight</M>, "for, since I began the blessed study, it has pleased God to prove to me the full and perfect expiation my Saviour's death has made for sin; <i>this</i> glorious truth appears to me in the clearest view."</DiaM>

Here the castle bell sounded for evening repast, and Mac Morni and his daughter <Blend>attended the summons.</Blend>

As they descended to the drawing-room, the soft strains of the harp echoed through the lofty dome, and Connell and Donough, the two chief musicians were seated with their harps in the hall, while Donough had placed before him a piece of music which he had just been composing amid the wild scenery of Loch Allen wood.

The windows opening to the ground admitted the cool air of a sweet autumnal evening; two sentinels were pacing with slow and measured step the walls of the opposite rampart, and Conrad was directing some repairs, which the late attack of the enemy had made necessary.

<DiaM>"Master Conrad will be soon married," <M>said one of the sentinels to old Patrick, as Conrad left the rampart.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"And to whom do you think?" <M>asked Patrick</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Why, I think he's powerful fond of the lady Eva."</Dia>

<DiaM>"The lady Eva!" <M>said Patrick, (whose son was valet to Conrad;)</M> " Well, from what Thady says, I think it is the lady Mariot he's fond of."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Time will tell;" <M>answered his comrade, as the trumpet sounded for a change of sentinels</M>.</DiaM>

When the honied cup had gone round in the castle, the old knight, who delighted in leading the conversation to some useful subject, said, <DiaQ>"I was thinking to-day, while perusing St. Patrick's gift, that if the blessed book went by any name but <i>the Bible</i>, it would be eagerly sought after. Suppose it was called Oriental Selections, or Flowers from the East, or any fine romantic title you please, at once would the antiquarian, the poet, the painter, the man of taste, the man of feeling and sentiment, at once would they endeavour to obtain it; its lofty sublimity, its beautiful simplicity, its poetical imagery, its fine subject for the pencil, its natural heart-touching pathos, not to say a word of its divine origin, and end, -— all those attractions would be quite sufficient to make it universally read, and universally admired."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Pray, father," <M>said the lady Sabina, who sat attentively listening</M>, "was Christianity first preached in Ireland by St. Patrick?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"By no means, my love, it was first preached here by a disciple of St. Peter's, (Mansutus;) and then St. James, the son of Zebedee, visited the Island, and proclaimed the glad tidings."</Dia>

At this moment, Donough entered the room, and, bowing low, he said, <DiaQ>"The harp in the house of hospitality requires tuning, please your highness; the travellers have no comfort in playing on it."</DiaQ>

<Dia>"Set off then in the morning, Donough, and tell the Beatagh to have every thing in order. The rites of hospitality should be one of our first concerns."</Dia>

<DiaM>"How is Noracreina, Donough?" <M>said Mariot</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"At your command, lady," <M>replied Donough, bowing again</M>, "my poor girl was sick for a few days with a cold she got in the valley, tending the sheep, but she is finely now. Would you wish, lady, to hear a little air, which I composed in honor of my child?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Very much, indeed;" <M>replied Mariot</M>.</DiaM>

Then hastening to the hall, Donough struck the chords of his harp to the pleasant notes of Noracreina, (a little air, which to this day is heard with pleasure,) at the same time accompanying it with words expressive of his paternal tenderness.

While he sung, a blazing fire appeared on the opposite hill, and a confused murmur of voices was heard from a circle that danced around the pile, and at the same moment <ArrivalDeparture>Teague entered the room</ArrivalDeparture>.

<DiaM>"The Irish vintage begins to-morrow, please your highness," <M>said he, bowing low</M>; "would you wish to have the cellar stored from the vineyard or the garden?"</DiaM> —- <Dia>"From the garden, by all means, Teague; nothing could be nicer than the last wine distilled from the rose and honeysuckle; and let some ale be brewed from the heathy hill near the valley."</Dia>

Next moment Mariot said, <Dia>"Pray do, Conrad, read for us that pretty poem written by your father, the story of the Nun of St. Catherine's Abbey; it always interests me so. You say you have often seen this Nun."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I was quite a child when I saw her," <M>replied Conrad</M>; "but while youth, beauty, and sweetness, hold any power over my feelings, I shall not easily forget the Nun of St. Catherine's Abbey."</DiaM>

<ArrivalDeparture>Conrad then hastened to his tower</ArrivalDeparture> to procure the poem, and Mariot said, <Dia>"I believe St. Catherine's Abbey was the first female Irish convent?" "No," replied the old knight, "the first convent established for females in Ireland was Kill Leaden Abbey, in the county of Carlow."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I thought," <M>said the lady Sabina</M>, "there was a famous female convent in the county of East Meath?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You're right, my love," <M>answered her father</M>; "but it was before the introduction of Christianity, when the sun and moon were worshipped. The convent consisted of thirty young ladies of the first rank in the kingdom, and their duty was to keep constantly burning the sacred fire dedicated to the sun and moon."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I believe," <M>said the lady Sabina</M>, "the abbey was called ‘The Place of Retirement till Death?'"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes," <M>replied Mac Morni</M>; "but transient was their retirement, for one fatal day a number of abandoned wretches broke into this dedicated retreat, and inhumanly murdered the unfortunate and unoffending young women."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I don't exactly remember the reason why," <M>continued the old knight</M>, "but, to the best of my remembrance, their animosity arose from some opposition in their fanatical religious opinions, religious faction at the time being carried to a great excess."</DiaM>

Here <ArrivalDeparture>Conrad returned with the poem</ArrivalDeparture>, and read aloud the following: -—

<WrittenTextRead><QuotedText>THE NUN.
In an abbey remote, on the banks of the sea, 
A story is told of a Nun
Who' oft times would hie to the <i>dark frowning cliff</i>
To gaze on the wave, or to watch the light skiff, 
Lit up by the beams of the sun.

And oft would a tear from her beautiful eye 
Fall fast on her bosom of snow;
And oft would the tempest, or light evening gale, 
Tinge faintly her pale cheeks -— or wave back the veil
That shrouded her features of woe.

And as the soft breeze from the ocean blew by, 
'Twould touch its light wing 'gainst the vest
That shaded her bosom -— and there all betray'd, 
In warrior's costume and helmet array'd, 
A picture which hung on her breast.


And now would she start, as the organ's loud note 
Warn'd quickly the sisters to prayer;
And, entering the abbey, she'd hush her sad sighs, 
Endeav'ring to smile, and to dry her blue eyes,
And calm every trace of despair!

But vain were her efforts, to hide from the glance 
Of the keen mother Abbess, her woes;
Who press'd her with friendship and sympathy's tone,
That she would at once the dark mystery own, 
And all her sad story disclose.

The desolate heart of the poor Nun soon felt
The balm that soft pity affords;
Yet still would she say, "sire was pleas'd with her lot,
"Indeed she was happy -— <i>why</i> think she was not?" 
But tears contradicted her words!

One eve, as the last hour of vespers had toll'd,
This Nun softly stole from her cell,
And, lost in deep thought, she continued to weep, 
'Till heedless, she found herself far in a deep
And close-tangled sycamore dell.

She look'd all around her, -— the wild mountain stream
Ran hoarse, and the breezes blew cold,
The night became dark, for the moon hid her ray, 
While the wave in deep sound flung its light snowy spray,
And swift through the dark cavern roll'd.

The Coorisk scream'd loud, as it flew o'er the wood,
The yew-tree its ancient bough shook,
The brown wither'd leaves of sad autumn fell round
And cover'd the path-way, and strew'd the dark ground;
And hoarse ran the stream of the brook.

When sudden and sad, on the breeze of the night,
The sounds of soft music she heard;
She started! -— it ceas'd —- and then struck up again, 
And then a tall form swiftly flew thro' the glen,
And then 'mong the trees disappear'd!

Ella's heart died with terror, -— Oh ! what can it be?
Again see it dart thro' the trees!
But hark to that note! -— and she rais'd up her head,
"Protect me, sweet Virgin, protect me," she said;
"Hark, again!" -— and she sunk on her knees.

And just as the sad and sweet musical strain
Had stole o'er the woodlands and lawn,
The figure approach'd! — Ella starts! shrieks and flies,
And swift o'er the meadows and valleys she hies,
And bounds through the woods like a fawn.

Arriv'd at the abbey, she paus'd, weak and faint, 
For fear made her bosom to ache;
But the figure was gone! -— and no sound, save the breeze
Sighing, sad 'mong the chesnut and sycamore trees,
Which grew on the banks of a lake.

Now thro' the great portal gate she got in,
And softly stole up to her cell;
But thought was disturb'd, and she only could dream
Of the strange and mysterious, tho' musical theme, 
And the form she had seen in the dell.

Next eve, when the sun had sunk low in the west,
To her favourite cliff Ella strayed,
And snatching the portrait that hung on her breast,
She kiss'd it -— and gaz'd -— and again fondly press'd 
To her lips the inanimate shade.

"My husband! -— my Anley! -— my dearest best friend,
My warrior, gentle and brave.
Hark! —- a rustling!" -— she starts, and looks fearfully round,
But no! all is silent, 'twas only the sound
Of the breeze as it swept o'er the wave.

And now the lov'd portrait again she address'd; -— 
"Thou faithful resemblance of him
Who" -— again she starts up, and strove quickly to hide
Her portrait -— for gazing, quite close by her side, 
Lo, stood the tall Abbess so grim!

This woman was form'd by Hypocrisy's hand,
And cast in her dark hated mould, 
Deep cunning insidiously lurk'd in her heart, 
And threw o'er her features its magical art,
Designing, keen, subtle, and bold.

In cunning's vile whine, the sad Nun she address'd,
"What a pity a maid of her years
"And beauty, and sweetness" -— poor Ella look'd up,
And, gull'd with the drops of Hypocrisy's cup, 
She sigh'd, and then burst into tears!

At length did the magic of Sympathy's tone
Draw forth from her anguish its stings;
And sighing again -— and averting her face, 
She drew from her pocket an ivory case,
And handed the Abbess two rings!

"<i>Two</i> rings! -— <i>wedding</i> rings! -— Holy Mother of God!
You're <i>married</i>, vile daughter, I say!" 
"Oh! yes! to <i>two</i> spouses I'm married!"she said, 
Then wildly she shriek'd out, and, striking her head,
Shriek'd again, and then fainted away.

And when she recover'd she found henelf laid 
'Mid the darkness and gloom of the night,
In the high northern tower, without table or chair,
Damp and cold; a small window just let in the air,
But scarcely admitted the light.

"Protect me, kind Heaven! sweet Virgin, protect 
"A wretched disconsolate Nun.
"Oh! why did I hint at my story?" she cried, 
"Oh! why did I tell her?" and deeply she sighed:
"Now she knows it, and I am undone!"

Now mournfully pass'd the sad hour 'till near morn, 
A light distant footstep she heard,
'Twas sister Glorvina she earnestly hop'd;
"Oh! hap'ly 'tis she, -- but ah, no!" -— the door ope'd,
And the grim mother Abbess appeared.

"I'm come, guilty daughter," she solemnly said, 
"I'm come with this sackcloth and vest;
"Sharp penance alone can your crime wash away, 
"So give me no struggling -— here give me, I say,
"That portrait that hangs on your breast.

"Oh! take not." -— "I <i>will</i>," the grim Abbess replied,
And quickly she took off her hood,
And pull'd out a scourge -— then, with passion and strength,
<i>Scourg'd</i> poor Lila's shoulders and arms, and at length
Left her all streaming over with blood.

Then, snatching the portrait, she went off in haste, 
While Ella distractedly wept;
At length she got calm, and she sunk on her knees.
"Hark! a voice -— 'tis Glorvina -— no, no," -— 'twas the breeze, 
As o'er the high turrets it swept.

In anguish again did she weep; and, next morn, 
Ere the sun its bright lustre had shed, 
Glorvina, by friendship to Ella endear'd, 
Attended by grim mother Abbess appear'd, 
And softly walk'd o'er to the bed.

"Oh, God!" cried the Nun, while her mild friendly eye
Was dimmed by soft pity so sad.
"What means this emotion?" -- the grim Abbess cried.

"Oh, hush! mother, hush!" and most sadly she sigh'd;
"Don't you see wretched Ella is mad?"
"Oh, no! I'm not mad, gentle sister; no, no, 
"Indeed I'm not mad, no, in truth. --
"But the sun is up, and I must go,
"Where daffodils and cowslips grow;
"This night, sweet Nun, my bed must be,
"The heath that grows under the mulberry-tree.
"And there 'mong the old abbey arches I'll creep,
"And I'll sleep, sweet Glorvin, so sweetly I'll sleep,
"The weeds all around me, my head on a stone,
"I'll dream of my Anley, and Ardan, that's gone."

"The wind how it howls, and the tree how it shakes,
"Woe the day! woe the day!
"And my heart is so cold, and my poor bosom aches,
"Woe the day! woe the day!

"Pray give me a garland of roses so red:
"No, no, I'll not have it, sweet sister, no, no!
"I've a great mind to go, and to lay my poor head
"On Glenmalure's mountain, all covered with snow.

"They took my sweet babe, with his pretty blue eyes,

"Woe the day! woe the day!
"And they stifled my baby, -— your little faint cries.
"Woe the day! woe the day!

"But the sun is up, and I must go,
"Where daffodils and cowslips grow;
"This night, sweet Nun, my bed must be,
"The heath that grows under the mulberry-tree.

"Oh! I wish I was laid in my coffin so cold,
"Woe the day! woe the day!
"In a black velvet pall and a winding-sheet roll'd:
"Woe the day! woe the day!"

Thus saying, her scarf she wrapt quickly around 
Her fragile, but elegant, form,
And darting with speed down the steps of the tower,
She rush'd t'wards the ocean, tho' dark look'd the hour,
And cold, very cold blew the storm.

With speed did the gentle Glorvina pursue,
And there 'mid the ocean's high foam 
Sat poor wretched Ella, with looks so insane; 
The kind Nun approach'd, and in pity's soft strain,
She kindly entreated her home.

And now, when the tempest would furiously sweep
The clouds as they pass'd o'er the moon,
Poor Ella would fly o'er the rocks, bounding fast, 
Singing wildly, and mingling aloud with the blast,
The notes of some old Irish tune.

Sometimes by the high foaming wave she would sit,
And wait its approach without dread,
Then, wet with the spray, undismay'd by the shock,
She'd start up and smile -— then fly back to the rock,
And then to the foam bend her head.

Sometimes the dark cavern would echo around
To the heart-piercing shriek of despair;
Then dashing the tears from her sweet eyes of blue,
She'd snatch the wild weeds from the rocks as they grew,
And bind them in wreaths round her hair.

And then would she climb to the rock's dizzy height,
And stand as suspended in air
On some broken fragment, -— then franticly cry,
Look towards heaven, pause a moment, then suddenly fly,
Pause again, laugh, and shriek in despair!

At length she got calm, and a deep settled gloom 
Of this phrenzical wildness took place;
And all the day long she would sit in the wood, 
Indulging in silence her sorrowful mood, 
With tears streaming fast down her face.

One evening she snatch'd up a harp, and in haste 
Struck a few wild and heart-touching chords, 
And, as o'er the air its wild melody breath'd, 
(Her brown hair with roses and sea-weed all wreath'd,)
She warbled the following words: -—

"They say that Ella's mad, and yet
I do not think 'tis so,
For last night o'er the heathy dell
I wander'd where the torrent fell.
All thro' the drifted snow.

"And then I form'd the wild sea-weed
In many a gay festoon,
And, while all wetted with the spray, 
I warbled forth the sweetest lay,
To please the list'ning moon.

"They say that Ella's mad, and yet
I do not think I am, 
For in the wood I found, and press'd 
Quite closely, fondly to my breast,
A pretty little lamb.

"Twas sick, and on my arm I laid
Its head -— and then I wept 
And griev'd -— and then it fell asleep, 
And I with caution ceased to weep,
To watch it while it slept.

"It died -— and I, with many a tear, 
Soon form'd a little grave,
And in this grave my lamb I laid,
While o'er it's pretty head I made, 
The willow-tree to wave.

"And as I wept, a redbreast came 
And perch'd upon my knee,
I smiled, and said, Upon my word 
I dearly love my little bird;
Sweet robin, stay with me.

"Then do not say that Ella's craz'd, -— 
Such harshness makes her sad, 
Each thought bespeaks a settled mind; 
Do mark me now, and you will find, 
That Ella is <i>not</i> mad!"

Poor Ella's sad story was piteous to hear; 
Betroth'd to a youth whom she lov'd,
Fate frown'd on their union, -— and he, o'èr the main,
With heart stung by grief, in the warrior's train 
To India's far region remov'd.

And e'er a few moons had their soft splendor shed, 
O'er the mountain, the valley, and plain;
In war with the natives of fierce Hindostan, 
While fighting so brave at the head of his clan, 
Ella heard that her Anley was slain.

With anguish of heart, she the tidings received, 
And then, sad and trembling, and pale,
To yon lonely abbey she eagerly sped,
And there, while her hopes lay all wither'd and dead,
Poor Ella had taken the veil!

And now time pass'd o'er, and her sorrowful heart
Had reconcil'd got to its fate,
When one eve as the bell toll'd the last hour of day
A figure approach'd, clad in martial array, -— 
'Twas Anley that stood at the grate!

The news of this warrior's death was untrue,
He had fought -— but escaped from the slain;
He hasten'd to claim his lov'd Ella's fair hand, 
And, bending his course to the Emerald land,
He swiftly pass'd over the main.

Nor language, nor pen, can the anguish describe,
Which seiz'd this unfortunate pair,
But brief be my story, -— forgetting her vows, 
Forgetting completely her heavenly spouse,
Ella wedded her Anley so dear.

But short was their triumphs, remorse with its sting
Soon poison'd their cup of delight,
Unceasingly Ella wept, fasted, and pray'd, 
With penitence striving God's wrath to evade,
While Anley took refuge in flight.

One beautiful baby crown'd poor Ella's love, 
But death took the treasure away;
And now in her flights, when she'd speak of this child,
In anguish of spirit, and language so wild, 
She'd talk in fantastical strain.

Sometimes she would say, by a fierce cruel clan 
Her sweet little Ardan was kill'd;
That in the dark valley of Glenmalure's plains,
By a chieftain commanding some barbarous train, 
The blood of her baby was spill'd.

The only indulgence poor Ella now sought
Was a walk to the rocks, or the wood,
And there would she sit, while the night winds would blow,
With hands closely clasp'd on her bosom of snow, 
To cherish her sorrowful mood.

The music and figure she met in this wood 
Were simply, as legends divulge,
A young shepherd swain, who would hie to their shades,
And strive with his lute, in the sycamore glades, 
A bosom love-lorn to beguile.

And now every day, as it pass'd o'er her head,
But added to poor Ella's woes,
At length with loud shrieks, wildly tearing her hair,
She flung herself off from a rock, in despair,
And sought in the ocean repose!

While the ancient crone, crossing her breast, sadly tells
That this rock is ne'er ting'd by the sun, 
But cold, dark, and desolate, lonely it stands, 
And while she relates, she lifts up her old hands
To pray for the poor luckless Nun!</QuotedText></WrittenTextRead></SceneDia>

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER IV.</ChapMarker>

<SceneFragment><Trigger>One evening</Trigger>, Lorcan and Mariot were standing in the window, and after a deep reverie, Lorcan said -—

<DiaQ>"Mariot, look out on that dark high wave, laden with the evening sunbeam, slowly sweeping in grandeur towards the cliff. Look again, Mariot, the cold darkness of the wave remains, but the bright beam is gone! So fled for ever the light of Lorcan's hopes! So set in endless night the ray that rose brilliantly on Lorcan's youthful heart!"</DiaQ>

As he spoke, Mac Morni passed the window, to commence his usual solitary walk to a lofty grove, near the castle.

<DiaM>"I grieve," <M>said Mariot</M>, "to find my dear father still continues to cherish those melancholy feelings: let us walk to meet him," <M>she added to the Lady Sabina, who shortly after had entered the room</M>; "our presence may beguile his sadness:"</DiaM> and, as the sisters approached the grove, they perceived the old knight through an opening in the trees, bending over an urn, round which the figure of Affection was placed in a mournful, weeping attitude, while the pensive birch and willow appeared solicitous to conceal the hallowed spot from the gaze of common observation. On the urn was written those words -—
<QuotedText>"When this fond heart is placed by thy side, Sabina, it will forget thee, but NEVER till then!"</QuotedText>

The next moment the old knight fell on his knees, and, after continuing a few moments in fervent devotion, he stood up, and soon joined Sabina and Mariot, whom he received with a melancholy and affectionate smile.</SceneFragment>

This little monument had been erected by Mac Morni, as a testimony of love to the memory of a wife whose death he had never ceased to deplore; and, though time had softened the acuteness of sorrow, still was her remembrance cherished by him with fond affection, -— and to fulfil with merit the important duties of a parent to the two daughters she had left, seemed to be the first wish of Mac Morni's heart.

As they proceeded on, they met a number of men returning from working at the gold mines near the castle, and one of them displayed an amethyst, which had been discovered the week before, of considerable size and beauty.

<SceneAction><Trigger>Next evening</Trigger> as they were walking in the wood of Glenallen, they perceived a tall female figure, wrapt in a long dark cloak, emerging from a tree; and hurrying on a few steps, she sunk on her knees, clasped her hands, smote her breast in evident sorrow, and, taking something from her bosom, she pressed it to her heart, and burst into tears. She then stood up, and approaching a little dark well which issued in silence from beneath the roots of a blasted oak, almost concealed by rushes, reeds, and flags, she took up a small cup chained to a flag by the well; and raising her eyes to Heaven, in much apparent devotion, she drank of the water, then went three times round the well on her knees, again smote her breast, and, again weeping bitterly, she stood up and walked hastily on.

<DiaM>"Tis Bridget, the pilgrim, I declare," <M>said Conrad</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Bridget, the Pilgrim!" <M>repeated Mac Morni</M>. "Impossible; surely she is on her way to Lough Derg!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I assure you it is Bridget," <M>said Conrad</M>, "I saw her quite plainly."</DiaM> <DiaM>"What an unhappy creature this old woman must be!" <M>said Mariot</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Let us leave Bridget to her God," <M>answered Mac Morni gravely; and, then evidently wishing to change the subject, he added, as they approached the little well, and looked at the rough pebbly circle round which the pilgrim had just passed on her knees</M>, "'Tis very strange," <M>said Mac Morni, after a moment's pause</M>, "that in the Bible I am now studying, I can observe no command for those self-inflicted grievances, no directions for those austerities and mortifications: to bear with resigned patience the evils that we cannot shun, to bend quietly beneath the stroke that God in his wisdom sees necessary to lay on us; this is what I perceive to be the spirit and tenor of the Bible; and let us beware, that, at the very moment we are afflicting ourselves with those fasts and penances, we are not giving way to some evil propensity. The greatest slave to those self-inflictions I ever met is old Murrough, and yet remark, that, on any particular day of fast or penance, he is always more easily irritated and put out of humor, than on any day of the week."</DiaM>

The party now wound round the base of an immensely high mountain; and, at the entrance of a dark and lonely cave, was seated an old man, in a singular dress; a scull and three human bones by his side, and a crucifix in his hand. -— As they passed, Mac Morni spoke to him; the solitary man looked up, bowed, but answered not: again the old knight spoke, and again the recluse bowed, preserving at the same time the most profound silence.

<DiaM>"That's the hermit of the mountain," <M>observed Eva</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Poor deluded creature," <M>said the old knight, as they walked on</M>; "he has, I suppose, imposed perpetual silence on himself, thinking, by such austerities, to rob his Saviour of the finished atonement his death has made for sin."</DiaM>

They now descended into a valley remote and wild, in the midst of which stood a high temple, glittering with a showy representation of the sun, moon, and stars.

On this edifice Mac Morni made some observations, and then, emerging from the valley, they walked round a chain of rocks, abrupt and difficult to pass. "Oh! dear," said the gay Eva, "how I totter, -— your arm, Conrad."

Here a slight blush passed over Mariot's cheek, and, hurrying on, they arrived on the smooth even sands, which stretched far underneath an immense ridge of cliffs, down whose perpendicular sides trickled many a mimic cascade, and whose dark caverns were strikingly contrasted with the white surges, which ever and anon, in regular and gradual succession, swept in slowly on the rocks, and then disappeared.

Kneeling by those rocks was a young female, of interesting appearance; her pretty face peeped through the black hair which rested on the ground as she knelt, and which nearly shaded her figure. -— A projecting cliff concealed the party from her view, and, thinking herself secure from observation, alternately she raised her hands, and alternately, in cadence soft and sweet, she sung the following: --

<Song>Neptune, from thy briny bower, 
Deck'd with many a wild sea-flower; 
Floating o'er the summer sea, 
Pause, and list, -— oh! list to me.

Neptune, from thy coral cave, 
Hush the tempest, calm the wave; 
Safely o'er the stormy sea, 
Bring my Sedna back to me.

Neptune, from thy wat'ry home, 
Dashing thro' the snowy foam, 
Floating o'er the summer sea, 
Grant this ardent prayer to me.</Song>

The fair songstress was proceeding, but, perceiving the party, she started up in confusion, and disappeared among the rocks.

<DiaM>"Who can she be?" <M>said they all</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"A young recluse," <M>replied Conrad</M>, "who lives with her parents behind that chain of mountains. But yonder is Rothecta, the monk."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Rothecta, indeed!" <M>said the old knight</M>.</DiaM>

The ladies looked forward, and beheld a tall emaciated figure reclining on a rock, apparently in deep meditation.

As they approached, he turned round, spoke slightly to Mac Morni, and, putting his hand to his eyes, reclined again on the rock.

<DiaM>"What a dark malignant countenance!" <M>said Eva</M>.</DiaM> The old knight made no reply, but he could not help internally subscribing to the remark.

<DiaM>"Oh! there he is again," <M>said Eva</M>; "dear me, what a frowning, appalling looking being!"</DiaM>

<QuotedLit>Dark and unearthly was the scowl 
That glared beneath his dusky cowl;
The flash of that dilating eye 
Revealed too much of times gone by: 
Tho' varying, indistinct its view, 
Oft will his glance the gazer rue; 
For in it lurks that nameless spell 
Which speaks, itself unspeakable, 
A spirit yet unquelled and high, 
That claims and keeps ascendency; 
And like the bird whose pinions quake, 
But cannot fly the gazing snake, 
Will others quail beneath his look, 
Nor 'scape the glance they scarce can brook: 
From him the half-affrighted friar, 
When met alone would fain retire;
As if that eye and bitter smile, 
Transferr'd to others fear and guile: 
Nor oft to smile descendeth he, 
And when he doth 'tis sad to see; 
That he but mocks at misery. 
Now that pale lip will curl and quiver
Then fix once more as if for ever, 
As if his sorrow or disdain 
Forbid him e'er to smile again;
     
His floating robe, around him folding, 
Slow sweeps he thro' the column'd aisle, 
With dread beheld, with gloom beholding, 
The rights that sanctify the pile;
But when the anthem shakes the choir 
And kneel the monks, bis steps retire 
By yonder lone and wav'ring torch, 
His aspect glares within the porch; 
There will he pause till all is done, 
And hear the prayer, but utter none; 
See, by the half-illumin'd hall, 
His hood fly back, bis dark hair fall, 
That pale brow wildly wreathing round, 
As if the Gorgon there had bound 
The sablest of the serpent braid, 
That o'er his fearful forehead strayed; 
For he declines the convent oath, 
And leaves those locks unhallowed growth;
And wears out garb in all beside,
And, not from piety but pride, 
Gives wealth to walls that never heard 
Of his one holy bow or word;
Lo! -— Mark ye, as the harmony 
Peals louder praises to the sky, 
That livid cheek, that stony air 
Of mixt defiance and despair! 
St. Francis, keep him from the shrine, 
Else may we dread the wrath divine, 
Made manifest by awful sign! 
If ever evil Angel bears 
The form of mortal, such he wears; 
By every hope of sins forgiven, 
Such looks are not of earth or heaven.
     
'Tis twice three years at evening tide 
Since first he to this Abbey came,
And here it soothes him to abide, 
For some dark deed he will not name.
But never at the vesper prayer 
Nor e'er before confession chair 
Kneels he, nor recks he when to rise 
Incense or anthem to the skies;
      
Much in his vision mutters he, 
Of maiden whelm'd beneath the sea;
Of sabres clashing, foemen flying, 
Wrongs aveng'd, and princes dying; 
On cliff he hath been known to stand, 
And rave, as to some bloody hand 
Fresh sever'd from its parent limb, 
Invisible to all but him;
Which beckons onward to his grave,
And lures to leap into the wave. BYRON.</QuotedLit>

<DiaM>"Oh! is this for me?" <M>said Mariot, hastily taking a letter from Dermot, who had just approached them</M>.</DiaM> 'Twas from the Princess of Munster, inviting her and her cousin Eva to the palace of Cashel, for the purpose of joining a party who were in the wing of pleasure to partake of the gay festivities of Tara.

<DiaM>"All the nobility of Fingal are to be there," <M>added the Princess</M>, "and my mother's crown will be the most splendid in the palace; she has just got some new diamonds for it."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh! dear, so delightful!" <M>exclaimed Eva</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"How like the little giddy Princess!" <M>said Mac Morni, as he returned the letter</M>. "I believe poor Edna thinks she is never to die, and that her youth and health are to last for ever."</DiaM>

As she spoke, the sweet notes of Elleen-a-roon were heard; made sweeter still by the murmuring breeze on which they floated: the party stopped. -— <DiaM>"Who plays that tune with such sweet expression?" <M>said Mac Morni</M>.</DiaM>

Conrad immediately darted into a little dell from which the sounds appeared to issue, but soon returned, saying, he could not discover the musician. <DiaM>"I will be more successful," <M>said the gay Eva, taking Conrad's arm and hastily walking towards the wood; and there, under a spreading sycamore, apparently wrapped in melancholy thought, was seated the minstrel, bending over his harp.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Don't let us disturb him," <M>said Conrad, drawing back</M>, "our presence will be intrusive."</DiaM>

At this moment the minstrel arose.

<DiaM>"He's coming towards us," <M>said Eva; but, suddenly snatching up his harp and walking on hastily, the trees soon concealed him from view</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Dear me, who can he be?" <M>said Eva</M>.</DiaM> —- <DiaM>"I can't think," <M>replied Conrad</M>; "but I often hear his harp as I walk through the woods, and Elleen-a-roon is always the air he plays."</DiaM>

Next moment, Conrad and Eva emerged from the dell, and after gazing at a mountain, cultivated even to luxuriance, the party proceeded to the castle, and the evening concluded by a game of backgammon between Eva and Conrad.</SceneAction>

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER V.</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia>After dinner next day, Mac Norm said, <Dia>"What answer, Mariot, do you intend giving the Princess Edna?"</Dia>

<Dia>"What answer would you wish me to give, dear father?"</Dia>

Immediately were Eva's eyes fixed with much anxiety on Mac Morni's face. <Dia>"You used to like the festivities of Para, dear uncle."</Dia>

<DiaM>"So I did, my dear Eva," <M>said Mac Morni, taking her hand</M>, "and should probably continue to do so, if this gift of St. Patrick, the Holy Bible, had not fallen in my way; but, Eva, the perusal of this sacred work has caused a wonderful revolution in your uncle's feelings; a wonderful change, indeed, has it made in his views and opinions. Your uncle once loved the world —- dearly loved it; St. John bids him, in his first Epistle, ii. 15, not to love the world, nor the things of the world, <QuotedLit>'for all that is in the world' says this apostle, 'the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world.'</QuotedLit>

"Now, my dear Eva, what do you call the pride of life? Surely if music and dancing, and feasting, and show, and splendor, be not <i>the pride of life</i>, I know not what is.

"I lately spent some time at the palace of Leinster, and really looked on the round of pleasure which the princess Edna was engaged in —- balls, parties, &c. —- as innocent gaiety; till, glancing in my Bible, I read -- <QuotedLit>'She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.'</QuotedLit>

"And I remember, on returning to my chamber one night, after a day of feasting and dancing, those words of the prophet Isaiah forcibly and painfully arrested me : -— <QuotedLit>'The harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts, but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the operations of his hands.' —- 'Therefore, hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitudes, and their pomp, and he that re-joiceth, shall descend into it.'</QuotedLit>

"I declare to you," <M>continued the old knight</M>, "for some time after I had read those awful verses, I remained quite overpowered, nor could I enjoy the scene of festivity which took place next day at the prince of Ossory's.

"Ah! no, Eva. Religion, as St. John expressly tells us, loves not <i>the pride of life</i>; she loves not -—," <M>repeated Mac Morni</M>:

<QuotedLit>"No, she loves not the pomp nor the grandeur of courts;
She loves not ambition or pride;
She loves not the feast or the banqueting hall,
The masquerade, play, nor fantastical ball;
Where Satan is sure to preside.
Oh! no! all her habits are simple and pure;
From pleasure's gay temple she flies, And while with the humble and meek she appears, 
She bids the sad mourner to smile thro' his tears,
And look to his home in the skies.
Yon village sequester'd, yon valley remote,
Those groves, and that moss-'tangled dell,
And those mountains so high, and those dark leafy shades,
And yon woodland so calm, with its sycamore glades,
Best suit sweet Religion to dwell."</QuotedLit></DiaM></SceneDia>

<SceneDia>A few evenings following, Conrad said, as they were all preparing for their usual walk, <DiaQ>"Let me fasten on this bracelet, Eva."</DiaQ> And the important matter being adjusted, the party proceeded.

<DiaM>"What a wild grandeur!" <M>said Mac Morni, as they descended the green slope leading from the castle, and gazing with much admiration at the immense oak forest over-hanging the hills, shading a rapid river which formed a broad sheet of foam as it flew with thundering sound to the ocean.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"And see," <M>said Mac Morni</M>, "how its waters flash and sparkle in the sunbeam!"</DiaM> <DiaM>"And those lofty mountains," <M>said Conrad</M>, "gradually sinking in perspective, how beautifully and fantastically are they stretched!"</DiaM> -- <DiaM>"Just," <M>said Mariot</M>, "like a curtain screening out the busy world."</DiaM>

Thus they continued to converse, till, in the adjoining field, they met the pretty Noracreina hastening, she said, to master Conrad, to tell him that the piece of silk she was cutting into shirts for him would not afford more than nineteen yards in each shirt, and that she could not dye it as bright a tinge of yellow as she wished.

<DiaM>"Oh!" <M>said the valuable Eva</M>, "Mr. Conrad is so slight, nineteen yards of silk will be quite enough in each shirt."</DiaM> -— <DiaM>"Quite enough, Noracreina," <M>said Conrad</M>; "but be sure let the sleeves fall in full folds to the knees. Is the fringe for my mantle finished?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It will be finished to-morrow, sir," <M>and the pretty <ArrivalDeparture>Noracreina returned back to her cottage</ArrivalDeparture></M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh! positively, here's Logaire," <M>said Eva; and Eva involuntarily drew up her head, and began laughing and talking, to give herself an animated appearance</M>.</DiaM>

Logaire was an officer who lived in the castle for the purpose of assisting in its defence, and who had been for some time on a visit with a neighbouring chieftain, and, after kissing Mac Morni and Conrad, and assuring them all, by the sun, moon, and stars, he was delighted to see them, <Blend>they returned to the castle</Blend>.

And as they drew round the social board, Logaire said, <DiaQ>"I have been for some days at the splendid palace of King Dermot, since I saw you? He is a most hospitable charming man; he gave me some Irish poems, which I shall do myself the pleasure of reading to-morrow, when you, ladies, are all seated at your wheels and looms."</DiaQ>

Before the Lady Sabina retired to her chamber for the night, she asked her father to repeat again for her those two impressive verses of the prophet Isaiah. -— He did so, and the last words she said when she was leaving the room were -- <DiaQ>"<QuotedLit>'The harp and the viol, the tabret and pipe, and wine, are in their feasts, but they regard not the work of the Lord, neither consider the operations of his hands.'</QuotedLit>"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"They are certainly very awful words," <M>said Mariot</M>; "awful indeed! they have almost determined me against joining the festivities of Para."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes," <M>said Sabina</M>; "and I think there's something very impressive in that verse, -— <QuotedLit>'she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth.'</QuotedLit>"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh! do you hear the two preachers?" <M>said the gay Eva</M>. "What a pity you were not both with St. Patrick in his last conference with the Druids!"</DiaM></SceneDia>

<SceneFragment>Next evening Conrad requested Mariot to sing a favourite Irish air which he had given her to practise.

<DiaM>"Eva will join me," <M>said Mariot, blushing</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I would prefer the sweet simplicity of your voice without any accompaniment," <M>replied Conrad; and offering his arm, (for gallantry and attention to the ladies were just as much, perhaps, if the truth was known, more practised by gentlemen in the fifth century than at the present day,) he led her to her harp, and after, as usual, charming her auditors, Conrad exclaimed</M> "Exquisite, enchanting, unrivalled Irish music, in some of its strains so soft, so tender, so complaining, so expressive of deep, unconquerable, determined woe, the next moment so wildly gay, so fantastically sportive, so irresistibly exhilarating."</DiaM></SceneFragment>

<SceneFragment><Graft>Before</Graft> they retired for the night, Mariot happened to go into an unfrequented room in the north tower, where, absorbed in profound thought, Lorcan was sitting gazing from the casement at the angry ocean, dimly illumined by the moon. -— Marriot was retiring, but reaching out his hand, Lorcan said, <DiaQ>"Mariot, come here, do, sweet girl, come here. —- Mariot, dost thou see yon wave, which will soon break in foam against the lofty cliffs? -— Dark and cold as that wave, was my Ethne's bed, and the night she left those paternal arms."</DiaQ> —- Here the old man burst into tears, and Mariot, with her usual sweetness, sat down by his side, and spoke many a word of comfort to the troubled soul of Lorcan.</SceneFragment>

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER VI</ChapMarker>

<SceneFragment>Next morning at breakfast, Logaire happened to mention some tale of scandal which was circulated in the neighbourhood.

<DiaM>"Beware of the law," <M>said Mac Morni, smiling</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I stand corrected," <M>replied Logaire, taking up a telescope, and walking towards the door</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Wait, dear Logaire," <M>said Mac Morni</M>, "the important duty of the morning is yet to be performed."</DiaM>

The influence of the old Knight was always felt and acknowledged, and Logaire returned.

<DiaM>"I found a verse in the Bible the other day," <M>resumed Mac Morni</M>, "where the prophet Jeremiah invokes the Almighty to pour out his fury on the families that call not on his name; which I own has much impressed me. I certainly think there is something fearfully presumptuous in a family standing up after breakfast, and entering on their daily avocations without reading a portion of this sacred work, and calling down the blessing of God; and I am determined, please heaven, never again to omit it."</DiaM></SceneFragment>

<SceneAction>At dinner, Mac Morni called out, -- <DiaQ>"Oh! positively, here we are, dinner half over, and the hall door close shut. Dermot, I wonder."</DiaQ> -— <Dia>"Indeed, please your highness, it was Teague."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Who can tell," <M>resumed Mac Morni</M>, "what traveller may pass?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Such an inhospitable appearance!" <M>said Mariot</M>, "pray Dermot -—"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Indeed, my lady, it was Teague."</Dia>

<Dia>"Well, tell Teague never again to be guilty of such a flagrant breach of hospitality."</Dia>

<DiaM>"And now for a walk to the cliffs," <M>said Conrad, starting up, in the course of the evening</M>: -— "Come, Mariot and Eva, come, come, you lazy girls; this high breeze, Eva, will give such a brilliancy to your complexion, it will be a matter of peril and danger to look at you; hasten on with your scarf, Mariot; why, you seem quite penseroso this evening."</DiaM> -—  <DiaM>"Does he think so," <M>said Mariot</M>, -— "he <i>sha'nt</i> think so;"</DiaM> and cheering up, the lively Eva herself could not talk in a strain of greater gaiety.

Scarcely had they walked a few paces, when a sudden storm arose, dashing furiously the astonished waves, which, hurrying swiftly to the shore, threw their high foam over-the rocks, and constantly made Conrad and his fair companions startle back to avoid being wet by the sprinkling spray.

At the same moment, the pretty recluse, who had been lately singing so sweetly to Neptune, appeared walking on hastily to the adjoining village. Unmindful of their presence, she instantly fell on her knees, and, with streaming eyes, implored the tempest to protect her beloved husband from danger. The storm blew too high to admit of a longer stay, and the trio hastened back to the castle.</SceneAction>

<SceneFragment>Next day, Conrad said, as he returned from walking, -— <DiaQ>"What a number of Abbeys are building at present throughout the kingdom. I have been just looking at the plan of an Abbey which they are speaking of erecting at Mucross, by the lake of Killarney."</DiaQ> —- <DiaM>"Oh! such a lovely spot for religious retirement," <M>said the Lady Sabina</M>.</DiaM> -— <DiaM>"I forget the number of cells it is to contain," <M>resumed Conrad</M>, "and they intend purchasing, for the gallery, the finest organ in Europe; however, the Abbot of St. Bernard was saying, —- they may be speaking of the plan, for many a day before they put it in execution."</DiaM></SceneFragment>

<AuthorWe>We</AuthorWe> must now visit for a moment the Abbey of St. Bernard. -— <SceneIterative>It was a frequent custom of Rothecta to fly from the convent the moment the evening bell chimed for vespers, and, rushing down among the rocks and cliffs, repeat words similar to the following: -—

<WrittenTextRead><QuotedLit>"Waste not thy orisons, —- despair
Is mightier than the pious prayer.
I would not, if I might, be blest;
I want no paradise but rest."
    
Then, with the hurried tread, the upward eye, 
The clenched hand, the pause of agony,
That listens, startling, lest the step, too near 
Approach intrusive on that mood of fear;
Then with each feature working from the heart
With feelings loos'd to strengthen, -— not depart;
That rise -— convulse -— contend -- that freeze, or glow,
Flush in the cheek, or damp upon the brow;
Then, stranger! if thou canst, and tremblest not,
Behold his soul, the rest that soothes his lot!
Mark, how that lone and blighted bosom sears
The scathing thought of execrated years!
Behold —- but who hath seen or e'er shall see
Man as himself —- the secret spirit free?
Fear'd —- shunn'd —_ belied, ere youth had lost her force.
He hated man too much to feel remorse,
And thought the voice of wrath a sacred call
To pay the injuries of some on all.
He knew himself a villain —- but he deem'd
The rest no better than the thing he seem'd,
And scorn'd the best as hypocrites who hid
Those deeds the bolder spirit plainly did.
He knew himself detested, but he knew
The hearts that loath'd him, crouched and dreaded too;
Lone, wild, and strange, he stood alike exempt
From all affection and from all contempt,
His name could sadden, and his acts surprise:
But they that fear'd him dar'd not to despise;
Man spurns the worm, but pauses ere he wake
The slumbering venom of the folded snake;
The first may turn —- but not avenge the blow:
The last expires —- but leaves no living foe;
Fast to the doom'd offender's form it clings,
And he may crush -— not conquer —- still it stings!

Even at midnight would this dark mysterious Monk rise when the convent bell chimed the nocturnal rosary; and many a night, amid the dashing surf and howling storm, would he call on the name of Ethne, and implore her forgiveness.

Then would he pause, and strike his forehead, and pause again. —- <DiaM>"Forgiveness for <i>me</i>?" -— <M>he would add, wildly laughing</M>. "For <i>me</i>! Oh, no! there's no forgiveness for <i>me</i>; -— were an angel at this moment commissioned with a pardon, signed and sealed with the Almighty's own hand, a form like Ethne's would arrest his flight, and send back the celestial messenger to Heaven."</DiaM>

<Apostrophe>But, see the harbinger of day peeps o'er yon lofty mountain, beautifully, and yet scornfully, dismissing the deep dark drapery of the heavens. -— Back, back to thy cell, Rothecta, to bend, thy hypocritical knee at the shrine of St. Francis, and to mutter o'er thy beads, that there breathes not the air of heaven, such a wretch, such a villain, as Rothecta!</Apostrophe></SceneIterative>

<SceneQuasi>Mac Morni had a fine taste for painting; <Trigger>one day</Trigger> he said, <DiaQ>"Teague, bring from my study those two pictures I have just finished."</DiaQ>

On receiving them, he placed them on an advantageous point of view, and all turned to admire them. One represented a person in a splendid chariot, driving over a path strewed with roses, through the most lovely scenes imagination could picture; but, at the end of the path, was a dark unfathomable abyss, guarded by demons and fiends, from which sulphureous flames issued, and to which terrific scene the splendid chariot was evidently speeding. The other picture represented a man walking through a wilderness, cold, dreary, and dark, and, though many a thorn was strewed over the path he trod, it led on to a country so enchanting that, <DiaM>"you see," <M>said Mac Morni</M>, "I have drawn a veil over its beauties, totally unable to delineate them."</DiaM> <DiaM>"The allusion to those paintings," <M>resumed the old Knight</M>, "is so obvious, it is scarcely necessary to point it out. This first picture represents a worldly man surrounded with pleasures and enjoyments, hurrying on to the brink of death and hell. This other painting expresses the Christian walking on through the dreary cold wilderness of life to scenes of everlasting blessedness."</DiaM></SceneQuasi>

One day a letter was handed to the Lady Sabina from Erin, princess of Leinster, intimating her intention of paying them a visit on her way to Tara, and the next day her Royal Highness and retinue arrived at the castle of Glenmorni.

If ever perfection could be traced in female form, the Princess Erin could boast the rare endowment; her face was beauty, her figure was symmetry, her step was grace, her voice was harmony; and had the following words been written in Logaire's day, overwhelmed as he was in admiration, he would certainly have applied them to the beautiful princess:

<QuotedLit>"When you speak, I'd have you do so ever,
When you sing --,
I'd have you buy and sell, give aims, and pray,
In such sweet notes, and ordering your affairs,
To sing them too; or whensoe'er you dance,
To move you to the music, dulcet breath,
That I could fondly wish the motion were Perpetual."</QuotedLit>

<SceneFragment>The beautiful princess appeared at dinner, adorned with a profusion of amethysts and precious stones; and soon as the repast was ended, they all set out on their usual evening walk. Just as they had reached the wood of Glenallen, an old man, dressed in the strangest and most fantastic manner, emerged from a dark part of the wood, –— his feet, legs, and knees, were bare; –— over his shoulders was flung a short mantle; –— twined round his head, neck, and arms, were wreaths of oak leaves, and sprays of willow; and in his hand he held a large knife, while spots of blood were scattered over his garments.

Mac Morni immediately accosted him; but the reply of the old man was in a language quite unintelligible to the young people, and only faintly understood by Mac Morni; and, pointing to a distant grove, the grotesque figure was walking hastily on, when suddenly the Lady Sabina attracted his gaze: in apparent amazement he started back, looked earnestly in her face, and addressed her in his incoherent dialect; but, receiving no answer, he darted away, and disappeared in the wood.

<DiaM>"Good gracious!" <M>exclaimed the party</M>, "the man is mad."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"By no means," <M>said Mac Morni</M>, "by no means; I know him very well, and can assure you, however strange it may appear, that very man is a person not only of strong intellect, but of a cultivated mind;"</DiaM> then, entering into conversation on the subject, the young people deeply interested in every word, they walked slowly on to the castle, where, after continuing a few days, the lovely princess and suite proceeded to Tara, with a promise of returning soon as its festivities were over.</SceneFragment>

<SceneFragment>Conrad, having made some remark to Lorcan on the state of that part of the country where the old man dwelt in his youth; and on the superior style in which he heard Lorcan's castle was constructed; Lorcan sighed deeply, put his hand to his eyes, and in his usually peculiar manner said,

<Dia>"Oh! Conrad, Conrad, those days are gone, for ever gone, -— fled like the airy spirit of the mountain, when it dies away in the stillness of the midnight hour. Sad and dreary is the once splendid castle of Lorcan! silent and lone is his once hospitable hall! -— No more is heard there the voice of the Bard, -— no more echoes through the lofty dome the soft note of the lyre, -— Ethne's white arm no more rests on her harp, for cold and low lies my loved one beneath the dark rolling wave!"</Dia> ——

Conrad, anxious to draw off the old man's attention, talked of other things, but Lorcan appeared not to hear what was saying, and again reverting to the only subject that seemed for a moment to occupy his thoughts, he resumed, -—

<Dia>"When I left my castle in the morning, Conrad, the sun shone brightly, and all nature smiled around; -— but at night, when I returned, and with bitter anguish enquired what meant the terrible scene, a desolate blast from the wilderness rushed by me, and answered, -—

"'Death and destruction have been visiting the castle, and the rocks of Lammerlee are tinged with thy Ethne's blood!'"</Dia></SceneFragment>

<SceneFragment>At night the Bible was introduced, and when the chapter was ended, Mac Morni said, <Dia>"I read a verse in the Psalms this morning which much impressed me:

<QuotedLit>'Oh! how great is thy goodness which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee, which thou
hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the children of men.'"-Psalm xxxi.19.</QuotedLit></Dia>

Here the old Knight laid down the book, paused a moment, and then said, -— <Dia>"There is something inexpressibly beautiful in this verse, and my soul is overwhelmed with adoration and gratitude when I reflect on the happiness of Heaven. Oh! what a transcendent day of glory awaits the beatified spirit when it shall be introduced <i>by the hand of God himself, to those heavenly treasures which are laid up</i> for them that trust in him before the children of men, -— invented, wrought, by Omnipotence, and then <i>laid up</i>, waiting for the arrival of each ransomed soul."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I expect the Knight of the Valley next week," <M>obseived Mac Morni</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The Knight of the Valley?" <M>exclaimed the Lady Sabina, and sadly and deeply she sighed</M>; "will the Knight of Kerry accompany him?"</DiaM> -— <DiaM>"Or the Knight of the Golden Collar?" <M>said Eva, eagerly</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I believe the Knight of Kerry will, but I rather think the Knight of the Golden Collar will be taken up with the sports of Taltein. Scenes of dissipation and pleasure, I much fear, have more attractions for this champion of chivalry, than the domestic quiet which the castle of Glen-morni presents.

"I wish he could be influenced by a verse I read last night in Ecclesiastes.

"<QuotedLit>'Rejoice, oh, young man! in the days of thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes.'</QuotedLit>

"Now," <M>added Mac Morni</M>, "Listen to the awful conclusion of the verse.

"<QuotedLit>'<i>But know thou, that for all those things God will bring thee into judgment!</i>'</QuotedLit> —- Eccles, xi. 9.

"Tis exactly as if Scripture said, 'Do go on, simple young man; do go on; enter into all the amusements and gaieties of life, and never think of me, nor attend to your immortal concerns but be well convinced, oh! be well convinced, that for this indifference and neglect, or, in Scripture language, for those very things, God will bring thee into judgment.'"</DiaM></SceneFragment>

<SceneAction>Dinner was now announced, —- it consisted of a ham of wild hog, different dishes of curds, butter, and milk, mixed with various wild herbs, done up like a pudding, after which water-cresses and sorrell (the two latter always eaten in abundance,) were introduced; and when the goblet of mead had gone round, after returning God thanks, Mac Morni said:

<DiaQ>"Is any one disposed for a walk to the Abbey of St. Bernard? I wish to speak to the Abbot; or perhaps you would prefer sailing across the bay, it shortens the distance considerably."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Away for the canoe," <M>said Conrad, starting up</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh! no," <M>said Mariot, who always attended to the feelings of others</M>, "Eva dislikes the water, and the evening is so lovely, a walk through the woods will be quite pleasant."</DiaM>

Before the sentence was well finished, Eva <Blend>was half way up the steps</Blend> which led to her chamber in the north tower, to twine an additional string of amethysts round her arms and neck; and, taking Conrad's arm, they both preceded the party through the wood of Glenallen.

<DiaM>"I think there seems a great partiality between Conrad and Eva," <M>said Logaire</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Do you think so?" <M>asked Mariot; and she reddened as she spoke</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"A union between them," <M>remarked Mac Morni</M>, "seems a very probable circumstance, her father told me."</DiaM>

Here the strange wild man, who had formerly so much startled them, appeared again in the wood, and then, accosting Mac Morni, and looking very intently at the Lady Sabina, he said a few incoherent words, and passed hastily on.

After some observation on the strange appearance of this man, Mac Morni said,

<DiaQ>Oh! dear, how beautifully do those towers and spires of St. Bernard's Abbey appear through this opening in the trees. This was exactly a spot to which my dear friend, St. Bridget, loved to wander in this dark forest, so expressive of solitary silence and gloomy grandeur: she would sit and meditate, and, beneath that old chesnut yonder, she wrote many of those poems which I have so often shewed you. Her tasteful mind --------"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"You knew St. Bridget?" <M>interrupted Logaire</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Knew her!" <M>repeated Mac Morni</M>; "surely, she was my father's niece; and before she entered the convent of Kildare, she spent much of her time at the castle of Glenmorni."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have only a faint recollection of St. Bridget," <M>said the Lady Sabina</M>; "I was quite a child when I saw her, but there was a gentleness and kindness in her manner, which I still remember."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"She was, indeed, an amiable woman," <M>said Mac Morni</M>, "and, in the bloom of youth and beauty, devoted herself to the retirement of a convent. -— What a pity," <M>added he</M>, "that the powers of her fine mind should have been clouded by superstition; and yet she was more open to conviction, and less bigoted, than any one of her persuasion I ever met. Poor Bridget! how often have I wished, since I commenced studying my blessed Bible, to converse with you; with what pleasure should I have pointed out to you the simplicity of Christ's doctrine, and the errors of that religion which so powerfully holds in fetters our unhappy country."</DiaM>

The fact was, the more Mac Morni perused his Bible, the more dissatisfied did he become with the religion of his ancestors, till at length the traces of gloom and discontent appeared so visible in Mac Morni's fine and placid face, that it became a general whisper through the castle. But the same cause which wounded this good man, again restored peace to his soul, and he continued to read his Bible till <QuotedLit>"the day-star arose in his heart,"</QuotedLit> and he openly professed himself a <i>decided</i> enemy to the superstitious practices of the Catholic faith, and a firm believer in the <i>finished</i> atonement his Saviour's death had wrought. Diligently did Mac Morni adorn the doctrine he professed, and the precepts of the Gospel became the rule of every action.

<DiaM>"I was dissatisfied with myself this morning," <M>said he to the Lady Sabina, as, detached from the party, they both walked arm in arm through the woods</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And why, my dear father?" <M>said the Lady Sabina</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"I answered old Murrough with peevishness, and---."</Dia>

<DiaM>"But then he is such a stupid old man," <M>said the Lady Sabina</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"That is no excuse, -— none in the least. A religious man, my dear Sabina, must be a religious man on every occasion, in every hour, and in every moment of the day; it will not do to act the Christian hero one moment, and the slave of nature the next: religion is not to be used as a holiday suit, folded up and laid by, and only produced on some important occasion. It must rise with us in the morning, and lie down with us at night; it must stay close to us every day, and all the day long; it must guide our every action, every word, every thought; it must be called forth on every occasion, the most trivial, the most common-place. When we feel inclined to be annoyed at trifles, to be peevish or discontented, or ill-natured, to say an unkind word of an absent person, to feel the risings of pride, of anger or resentment, to return a petulant answer, or to use an irritable expression, then must religion shed its influence over our hearts, and keep the door of our lips."</Dia>

At this moment, Conrad pointed to the west, and remarked the great appearance of an approaching storm; and, the evening being now far advanced, they seemed to think it a wiser plan to return to the castle. -— <DiaM>"To-morrow," <M>said Mac Morni</M>, "will probably be more favourable for our visit to the abbey."</DiaM></SceneAction> <SceneDia><Graft>After supper</Graft>, which consisted of water-cresses and sorrel, the Bible was laid on the table, and the old Knight read aloud the 3rd of Romans, dwelling much on that unanswerable 28th verse:

<QuotedLit>"Therefore we conclude, that a man is justified by faith, without the deeds of the law?"</QuotedLit>

<DiaM>"What do you call the law?" <M>said Carbry, an old family bard, who had grown grey in the castle of Glenmorni.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Those holy, perfect rules and Commandments which God delivered on Mount Sinai."</Dia>

<DiaM>"And is it not the observation of those rules which will save us?" <M>asked Carbry</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"If we could observe them free from all imperfection, they certainly would save us," <M>answered Mac Morni</M>; "but, as by reason of human infirmity this is <i>impossible</i>, our blessed Saviour has found out another mode of justification, even the sacrifice of himself, -— yes, my friend, it is the death of Christ which alone can save us, and if"</DiaM> ----

<DiaM>"Oh! I know," <M>interrupted Carbry</M>, "that his death will make up the deficiency of our merit."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The death of Christ, my friend," <M>said Mac Morni in a solemn voice</M>, "has <i>completely</i> taken away our sins; there remaineth no other sacrifice for sin; and, in order to testify our gratitude for such an act, the believer (that is, the person who really believes this truth,) will do all the good that is in his power, to testify his gratitude for such mercy."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And suppose he does not perform those good works?" <M>observed Carbry</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Then he does not believe," <M>answered Mac Morni</M>, "and he can never expect to see the face of God; but, my dear Carbry, it is just as impossible for the sun to set in the northern wave, as for faith to be in the heart of man without manifesting itself by good works. Harken to those billows which are now foaming over the rocks. Suppose, my friend, you were drowning in that ocean, and that some person rushed in to save you; would you not feel grateful to this person, and would you not experience pleasure in attending to his wishes? In like manner, Christ has saved us from hell; and, in order to testify our love and gratitude to him, the believer endeavours to obey his commands, and to do all the good that lies in his power."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Well, you may talk as you will," <M>remarked Logaire</M>, "but I see no people who prosper more in the world than those very families who go on quietly, and make no fuss about religion. Now, there's our rich neighbour Thadeus, living in open adultery, and yet you see ----"</DiaM>

<DiaM><QuotedLit>"When the workers of iniquity do flourish," <M>interrupted the old Knight</M>, "it is, that they shall be destroyed <i>for ever</i>!"</QuotedLit> Psalm xcii. 7. -— "And we feel no great envy, my dear Logaire, towards a man walking through beautiful scenes, amid a bed of roses, if the scaffold awaits him at the end of his path. Now those very people who excite envy by their great prosperity and success, -— those very people," <M>repeated Mac Morni</M>, "may be objects of God's wrath."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And is it not uncharitable to suppose," <M>said Logaire</M>, "those people -—"</DiaM>

<Dia>"I know what you would say, dear Logaire. Not in the least degree uncharitable, for, when we see a family surrounded with worldly pleasure and happiness, and at the same time careless as to the duties of religion, we have <i>scriptural reason</i> for saying, that family is under sentence of death!"</Dia>

Here the castle bell warned them to retire for the night, and they separated to the eastern and western towers.</SceneDia>

<SceneFragment><DiaM><Graft>"Oh! Murrough,"</Graft> <M>said Mariot, whom she met as she walked along the balcony</M>, "have the chariot at the door at an early hour to-morrow; we intend going to visit the prince of Breffni."</DiaM>

Murrough bowed compliance, and passed on. —- <DiaM>"What a poetical name old Murrough has got," <M>said Eva, laughing</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I assure you, it was the name of the first Irish monarch who lived and died in the Christian faith," <M>replied Mariot</M>; "and my father was remarking how amiable real Christianity makes every one who feels its power, for this King Murrough and his Empress Sabina were patterns of excellence."</DiaM> At this moment, the old Knight, with a lamp in his hand, crossed the balcony, going on to his tower for the night.

<DiaM>"Pray, uncle," <M>said Eva</M>, "is it not a strange rule, (I was thinking of it this evening,) that all our Irish kings should be so very handsome?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"'Tis, in truth," <M>replied the old Knight</M>, "nor can I well account for it, but it is one of our oldest laws, that no man can be allowed to fill the Irish throne who is not as superior in personal appearance as in intellectual endowments."</DiaM></SceneFragment>

<SceneQuasi>Next morning, as the Lady Sabina and her father walked over the cliffs, he repeated the following: -—

<WritenTextRead>Like the waves of yon ocean, when summer is gone,
Dark and cold rolls life's sea, thro' the desert along,
Like the sun when he rises in splendor and power,
So beams sweet religion on man's dreary hour.

Oh! cold as the spray of the rock-beaten wave.
And dark as the long gloomy night of the grave.
And sad and desponding as misery's tear
Would this world, but for lovely religion, appear.

Oh! bitter and loud would the tempest assail
The poor Pilgrim's path, as he walks through life's vale,
And wounding and sharp would the sad thorns arise,
Were it not for the feeling that leads to the skies!</WritenTextRead></SceneQuasi>

There was a soft tenderness in Mariot's manners, that irresistibly attracted the unhappy to approach her; and Lorcan never seemed so soothed as when speaking to her.

<SceneDia><Trigger>One evening</Trigger> as she rambled over the cliffs, she perceived, reclining on a rock, (drench'd with the spray, which, unheeded by him, fell in foam upon his head,) this unfortunate old man. —- His face was pale as the marble hue of death, and his grey locks, streaming in the blast, gave him all the appearance of a mourning Druid, -— his lyre, whose chords had been wildly breathing the sadness of a wretched heart, lay neglected by his side, and his favourite dog sat looking up in his face, as if sympathizing in his master's woe.

<DiaM>"Dear sir," <M>said Mariot, approaching him</M>, "why sit exposed to this chilling blast? do return with me to the castle; see how furiously the waves rush to the shore, and hark how the wind howls among those caverns."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Such are the scenes which I love," <M>replied Lorcan</M>; "such are the scenes which best suit my gloomy soul; here no false-hearted man, no treacherous woman. Oh! could I but forget that cruel queen of Munster!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Surely, my dear sir," <M>replied Mariot</M>, "the queen of Munster ------"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Vindicate her not," <M>interrupted Lorcan, snatching Mariot's hand with a vehemence that made her start.</M> -— "Say not one word to extenuate the vile proceedings. Oh! Mariot, the insidious smile on that woman's face should be a warning against the depravity that lurks in her heart. Did not she herself give the diamond ring? and was not the letter found among her papers? I blame <i>not</i> the queen of Connaught, it was not in her power to protect my child; —- and the day my Ethne's babe was brought to her, she wept and pressed it to her heart, and wept again. -— Oh! unfortunate Lorcan, unfortunate old man! my adored wife murdered before my eyes, my brave and only son slain in my defence, my castle burnt to the ground, and I, wretched old man, left to mourn over the wreck of my departed joys."</DiaM> -— Here he wept bitterly, -— and Mariot, while tears poured down her face, said, -—

<Dia>"Now, pray, dear sir, be comforted; surely we must ----"</Dia>

<Dia>"<i>Comforted</i>, Mariot! --Oh! -— leave me, leave me, dear girl."</Dia>

<DiaM>"No! indeed, I will not leave you in this miserable way," -— <M>and again a tear trickled down her cheek</M>. "Oh! dear sir," <M>she added, putting her hand on his shoulder</M>, -— "you are quite wetted with the spray, and you know you have not been well this week."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"There spoke my Ethne, there spoke my sweet, my lovely child." -— <M>Here the old man paused, and then resumed.</M> "My Eileen, gone; my Hermon gone; my castle burned, -— my estates confiscated! and oh! I could bear it all; (don't weep, Mariot, don't weep, sweet girl;) yes, this old heart could bear it all, but for the tragical death of my Ethne, and her babe! —- oh! my loved, my loving, my lovely Ethne! Oh! 'tis your father's heart that's grieved for his Ethne! -— don't comfort me, Mariot, don't comfort me; -— no, I'll not be comforted, I'll never know one moment's peace again!

<QuotedText>"'Oh! could I rest with thee, my child,

"Oh! I see the beautiful face of my child, and I hear the silver tones of her voice, and I feel her soft arm twined around my neck, -— and at night in my dreams ——"</DiaM>

Here the burst of tears which succeeded those words, <Exclamation>told Mariot that the old man's heart was broken for ever!</Exclamation>

At length, after much argument, she persuaded him to return with her to the castle.</SceneDia>
