<ChBioIntro>Maria Maynard was the favourite of man, woman, and child; and had one signal token of being a favourite of Heaven; for <QuotedLit>“whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth.”</QuotedLit>

In early infancy she was deprived of her mother. A few years afterwards, the only sister of her father, devotedly attached to his child, took her, With his concurrence, to London, from her paternal residence in Wales, for the purpose of adding to the graces of nature, the elegances and accomplishments of polished life. During this absence from her home, which was of long continuance, her father died: — in a few years afterwards, and at the very crisis when her heart, mind, person, and manners, had realized the fondest hopes of her maternal friend, this tender relation was likewise taken from her; but not before she had bequeathed to her a legacy, in addition to the moderate inheritance which she had derived from her father. This bequest conferred not affluence, it is true, but it was all that the testatrix held in her own disposal.

And now, the wishes of the lovely and dejected orphan pointed to her native home, which she still remembered with yearning affection; and, although it was robbed of her father’s presence, there still remained upon the spot a dear and intimate companion of her childhood, a <ChNameIntro>.Miss Amyand</ChNameIntro>, who, with her mother, resided in the neighbourhood. Miss Maynard was urgently solicited to be their inmate, and with them, she, now in her twentieth year, gladly consented to take up her abode.</ChBioIntro>

At no great distance from the house of Mrs. Amyand, and on a small estate in a most romantic situation, lived <ChNameIntro>Mr. Villiers</ChNameIntro>, and his son;—a son, who was at once the delight of his father, and the admiration of all that knew him. The families were already in the habit of visiting each other, and the lapse of a few months increased their acquaintance to intimacy. An attachment grew, and daily strengthened, between <ChNameIntro>Edmund Villiers</ChNameIntro>, and Maria Maynard. The elder Mr. Villiers, with much of paternal tenderness, had something of the paternal pride which that tenderness too frequently inspires; the first effect of which had been an indulgence of the early, and ardent passion of his boy for military pursuits, — pursuits which originated rather in the enthusiastic interest he took in the history of ancient wars, than in his personal knowledge of the heroes of modern times. By the self-same pride, however, was the father now impelled to oppose the still more fervent passion of his son for his lovely neighbour, on whom, though all the gifts of nature were exhausted, those of fortune were, as we have seen, but sparingly bestowed. For two whole years, this opposition was continued; but the duteous struggles of a darling, and disappointed son, and the distinguished merits, and engaging manners, of Maria Maynard, at length overcame the resistance of the father. His full consent obtained, they were married; and, for twelve short months, were happy. Scarcely were those months expired, when the noble Edmund, who, by close attention to his profession, had risen to the colonelcy of his regiment, at the age of eight-and-twenty, was ordered to the East Indies.

His tender wife, who had recently become a mother also, sickened with sad forebodings at the news. The infant daughter which she cradled in her arms, had made her doubly a coward: she felt too surely that she was not a heroine, yet remembered that she was still a Christian; and that though, as a mother, she might tremble, yet, as a mother, she must resolve to act. He saw, and shared her struggles; and thus, with bursting hearts, and anguish ill suppressed, they parted.

Deep, and silent was the grief of the father at the separation; and long was the interval, before either the tenderness of his daughter-in-law, who, from this time, quitted him no more, or the daily opening smiles of intelligence in the countenance of her child, could bring him comfort. <SceneOther>At length, in the second year of his son’s absence, and just as he was again beginning to taste of hope, a newspaper, in which was recorded a battle against a powerful Nabob, in the interior parts of India, concluded its melancholy tale with a list of the officers who had fallen. In that list he had barely power to read the name of Edmund Villiers.

This stroke, which his parental anxiety had too often anticipated as probable, was not, on that account, the less severe. For a time, it left him stunned — but the sight of his poor Maria, who <Trigger>now</Trigger> came smiling into the room, unconscious of the coming blow, while it thrilled to his heart, irresistibly called on him to forget, if possible, himself in her. Instantly did she perceive that something had shaken him to the centre. A moment afterwards, he desired her to sit beside him; and, summoning at once the remaining energies of his mind, he tenderly prepared her for the wound he was enforced to give. She rivetted her aching eyes on his, as he proceeded through his mournful task; and when the dreaded truth was all unfolded, convulsively clasped her hands, and dropped lifeless at his feet!</SceneOther> A few days afterwards, the heavy tidings were too well confirmed by a letter from one of the surviving officers, which told of Edmund’s noble deeds, and honourable death; honourable in itself, and so felt, so welcomed, by him on whom it fell; for, to this account it was subjoined, that, while he lay, still bleeding, on the field, he was overheard faintly repeating to himself, —

<QuotedLit>“Dulce et decorum est pro patriâ mori.”</QuotedLit>

<Exclamation>The same fatal epistle enclosed to the wretched widow, from his own dying hand, his last farewell!</Exclamation>

<QuotedLit>"Long were to tell”</QuotedLit> what was endured of bitter grief, by the unhappy father, and heart-wounded wife. The sufferings of the former were shortened by a more advanced age; and infirmities, increased by sorrow, soon released him from the load of life. This second stroke, while again it smote the heart of Maria, seemed, yet, to bring with it one alleviation, — that of freeing her from the cruel duty of exerting her own broken spirits in unavailing efforts to support those of her father and friend: she, accordingly, resigned herself, with a mournful satisfaction, to the full indulgence of her grief. Her father-in-law had left her his estate, together with the house which they had inhabited. There, for three long years, did she continue to shut herself from all who would have approached to comfort her. General condolences she dreaded to receive; and Miss Amyand, already mentioned as her most intimate friend, and whose marriage had taken place within a short period of her own, had, with her mother and husband, left the kingdom.

At length, the improving stature of the little Helena, and the idea that her infant mind would soon require an instructor, and a guide, roused her from the lethargy of grief, and she awoke to thought, to action, and, at last, to hope. She resolved to look towards the future for her child, and, in her child, for herself. She admitted the few associates afforded by her retirement, as feeling that they would be conducive to the amusement of her Helena, and were almost essential to the expansion of her mind, as well as the ease of her manners.

She now devoted herself, with exemplary constancy, to the welfare of this beloved child, and contemplated, with a mother’s interest, the effects of her growing graces on her admiring friends; — though oftentimes the kindling smile was quenched in tears, as the image of Edmund rushed upon her mind, and she mused on the delight with which the father would have watched those graces, and advanced them to maturity. Great, however, was the rapidity of this advancement; and the mind thus anxiously treasured, was enclosed in a casket altogether worthy of the jewel within. Certainly, the beauty of Helena was of a kind, and degree, that could not but be highly flattering to the fond ambition of a mother.

<ChPortrait>To draw the picture of the pretty Helena would task alike the pen, or pencil. Nature, though she gave her to be "baptized in tears,” endowed her with a vivacity and versatility of character, which were eloquent in her countenance; and when that countenance was lighted up with smiles, it shone like a sun-beam on her, mother's heart. But the peculiar spirit which informed her beauty we will leave to manifest itself as we proceed: — the surface of it was not far from this: — her eye was the very azure of the heavens: — it was a long eye; — large it was not — nor certainly was it small: — neither its size, nor form, however, could have been other than they were, without injury to the face which it illumined. It was naturally a lively eye; but when the long, dark, silken lashes that overshadowed it, were bathed with the drops of pity, or of penitence for the little sins of childhood, so tender was its look, that Carlo Dolce might have transplanted it to the face of a weeping Magdalene. Her complexion was distinguished for the rosy brilliancy of its tints, and soft was the satin on which those tints were laid; while the general effect of her countenance was heightened by the auburn curls which clustered round it. Her nose was of that subtly rising contour, which exhibited a turn peculiarly adapted to a face of animation, and absolutely appropriated to her face. Her mouth was yet more difficult to delineate than all the rest — attended as it was by a playful dimple or two, which appeared, and disappeared, with every varying feeling. Add to all a sylph-like figure, and the prettiest hands and feet in the world, and you have Helena before you, as nearly as I can present her, such as she was, her mother’s idol, at ten years old; — for so much time has stolen away, while she has been learning to read, and work, and write; besides having made a very considerable progress in the rudiments of French, drawing, and music; in all of which it was the business and delight of her accomplished mother, to be her sole instructress.</ChPortrait> From this time, she proposed to herself great, and important assistance in the culture of her daughter’s understanding, by the kindness of a neighbour, who held the highest place in her preference and good opinion — the rector of the village she inhabited — <ChPortrait>Mr. Melcombe. This gentleman was a younger son of a noble family: his education bad been worthy of his birth; and he had reaped from both, those bright advantages which equally qualified him for retirement, and for the world; while, happily, from his high connexions he had obtained a Living, together with a large addition to his fortune, while he had youth and health to give them value. He had pow been in possession of his benefice for several years; discharging his sacred functions in a manner that commanded equally the love, and he veneration of all — <QuotedLit>"high and low, rich and poor.”</QuotedLit>

<QuotedLit>“By him, the violated law spoke out
Its thunders; and by him, in strains as sweet
As angels use, the gospel whisper’d peace.”</QuotedLit>

He was religious, without a taint of bigotry; and, what was still more rarely meritorious, without a spark of animosity against the bigotted. With such, he would sometimes reason; and if they were gloomy and despairing, he would pity, but he never scorned them. Charitable he was, in every import of the word. He was profoundly learned too; yet thought it necessary, as well as felt it natural, to be perfectly well-bred. With all these perfections, at the age of six-and-thirty, he was still unwedded; but whether by choice, or fate, was not surmised.</ChPortrait>

At the period of which we are now speaking, this exalted Character had under his friendly charge a certain Youth, whose father, while he was himself amassing a fortune for him in India, had left him, in his childhood, to the protection of Mr. Melcombe, the chosen companion of his early days. <ChNameIntro>Frederick Beaumont</ChNameIntro> was, at this period, thirteen years of age, and stood very high, in character and situation, at Eton school. No time was lost in his vacations; for they were passed in reading, walking, riding, and conversing, with his beloved instructor and friend. His gayer hours were spent, for the most part, in frolicking with Helena, in her mother’s garden. Sometimes, too, he would assist her improvements in drawing, in which he had, himself, made very considerable advances; but his greatest delight was in riding by her side with Mr. Melcombe, who was just beginning to teach her to hold her bridle, and sit a pretty little snow-white poney, which, at this time, was her newest and favourite plaything. Mr. Melcombe was extravagantly fond of her, and when she paced, and prattled along, between himself and Frederick, it was difficult to say which looked the happiest of the three. Now and then, when she was more inclined to laugh with Frederick, than attend to her horse, the grave preceptor would pretend to scold, and tell her to mind her bridle, or he would not take her out another time.

<SceneAction><DiaM>"O yes you will, Sir;" <M>said she, <trigger>one day</trigger></M>, "and, besides, I know you and Frederick will take care of me: — as for him, if poney does but trip the least in the world, he is always ten times more frightened than I am.”</DiaM>

<Dia>"But what could I, or even <i>Frederick</i> do, should Frolick run away with you ? He is but a foolish Frolick, and if we were to pursue him, would only scamper away the faster; and if you should fall off, and break your little neck, what would become of poor mamma ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"O my pretty mamma! — well, now I will be very good indeed, if you will but put the bridle right once more.”</Dia>

Frederick was <FIDquotes>"sure <i>he</i> could do that;"</FIDquotes> —but before he had time to take hold of it, Frolick, with a sudden nod, had twitched it out of her hand. It fell, and entangled his foot, which both incommoded and alarmed him, and he began to wheel about, still treading on the bridle, and appearing to be every moment ready to fall, with his trembling little rider, to the ground; but Frederick, who in an instant had dismounted, seized his foot, and while Mr. Melcombe took charge of Helena, disentangled the bridle, and set poney on his legs again; — but, colouring with terror at what might have happened, cried out —

<DiaQ>"Helena, Helena, why did you let it go ?”</DiaQ> — She mounted again with great composure, saying,

<DiaQ>"So! now you are going to scold!”</DiaQ> At last, all was adjusted, and they rode peaceably on to Mrs. Villiers’s house, where she was anxiously watching for them at the parlour window. Mr. Melcombe took Helena from her steed with the greatest care, gave her an affectionate kiss, and away she ran to her mamma.</SceneAction>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. II.</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia>On the following morning, Mrs. Villiers, having spent some hours in the instruction of Helena, dismissed her to her amusements in the garden: and Helena, <trigger>perceiving</trigger> an <ChNoNameIntro>old man</ChNoNameIntro> who was frequently employed to work in it, and with whom she had formed the <i>strictest friendship</i>, was presently at his side. She would often stand near him, watching him at his occupation, and asking him a hundred pretty questions, which he was ever ready to answer, and sometimes would she busily employ herself, under his directions, and delight in fancying that she was of prodigious use to him in his labours. She had been thus engaged for about an hour, while Mrs. Villiers had been sitting at her work. Helena entered —

<DiaQ>"Pray, mamma, what sort of a place is London ?”</DiaQ>

<Dia>"A large question, Helena: perhaps you may see one day or other; but what put London in your head just now ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"Why, mamma, old Bernard says it’s the D—l’s Country — naughty word you know! — he says he saw him there, and told me a great deal about it; it’s a very pretty story, mamma; do, let him tell it you himself.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Old Bernard talks nonsense; — but my dear child, how you have heated yourself! what have you been about ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"Hard at work, mamma, helping old Bernard.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Well, now, go and take off your bonnet, and then come and help me; — for I am tired of this hearth-rug, and want it finished.”</Dia>

Away she flew, but <ItalicsOther><i>flew</i></ItalicsOther> not back. Mrs. Villiers began to wonder what was become of her. At last she appeared.

<Dia>"What have you been doing all this time, Helena ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"Curling my hair nice, mamma. Old Bernard said it was very pretty; so, I was looking at it in the glass, and I quite forgot you were waiting for me.”</Dia>

<Dia>"What should old Bernard know about hair, child ? do sit down, and shade that flower as I have done this.”</Dia>

<Dia>"Yes, mamma.”</Dia>

At that moment entered Frederick, with his arm full of new books.

<Dia>"O mamma, look at Frederick!”</Dia> — He approached, and, with whimsical gravity, dropped on one knee to Helena, and, tottering, presented the books,

<DiaQ>"With Mr. Melcombe’s duty to Miss Villiers.”</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"How kind is Mr. Melcombe!” <M>said Mrs. Villiers.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Mr. Melcombe’s <i>duty</i> to <i>me</i>, mamma!”</Dia> <Descriptor>— and she laughed, and chuckled, for a minute</Descriptor>; and then, with assumed dignity, befitting the occasion, prepared to receive them graciously: when Frederick, having lost his gravity, — and his balance, tumbled them all on the floor. Not being in a sedate mood, he made another overset in picking them up — saying,

<DiaQ>"I am as awkward as Lord Chesterfield’s awkward man."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Does Mr. Melcombe let you read Lord Chesterfield ?” <M>asked Mrs. Villiers</M> --</DiaM>

<Dia>"Only a selection, Ma’am: he says I must not read the letters through — there they are, and I never see them but my fingers ache to pull them down.”</Dia>

<Dia>"But you never do, I am sure, Frederick.”</Dia> —

<DiaM>“No, Ma'am,” <M>said Frederick, emphatically, and a little proudly</M>: "but was it not rather odd, Ma’am, for Lord Chesterfield to write to his son, what I must not read?”</DiaM>

<DiaM>“I think it was, Frederick, and so thought a greater man than either of us,” <M>said Mrs. Villiers laughing — and opening a volume of Cowper's poems, which lay on the table, she pointed out to him those beautiful lines which begin thus: —

<QuotedLit>"Petronius! all the muses weep for thee,
But ev’ry tear shall scald thy memory.
The Graces, too, while Virtue at their shrine
Lay bleeding under that soft hand of thine,
Felt each a mortal stab in her own breast,
Abhorr’d the sacrifice, and curs’d the priest.” &c. &c.</QuotedLit></M>

"Do not forget them, Frederick, they will serve you as an antidote to Lord Chesterfield’s poison.”</DiaM>

Helena was lost in all the books. They were "Goldsmith’s Natural History,” and "L’Ami des Enfans.” A volume of the latter was in her hand —

<Dia>"O mamma, may Frederick read one of these stories to us ?”</Dia>

Mrs. Villiers — laughing — <Dia>"You should ask Frederick’s leave before mine, I think, Helena.”</Dia> — <Dia>"O, <i>he</i> will, I know; — won’t you, Frederick ?”</Dia>

He read. The story was interesting. Mrs. Villiers cast a side-glance at the flower: — it was spoiled. Helena was reproved for carelessness; — she received the reproof with looks of humility, and promises of immediate reparation; and Mrs. Villiers told her, that, as she was so penitent, she might lay aside her work, for the present, and attend to Frederick.

<Dia>"What’s being penitent, mamma ?”</Dia>

<Dia>"I will tell you another time; but Frederick’s hours are precious; if he is to read, let him go on.”</Dia>

He did so — and when he had ended the tale and was taking his departure, Helena loaded him with a thousand thanks, and loves, to Mr. Melcombe, for his <FIDquotes>"beautiful present.”</FIDquotes>

<Dia>"But before you go, Frederick, mind, you have not put the moss upon my geraniums: — go, and do it now.”</Dia>

<DiaM>"Helena!” — <M>said Mrs. Villiers</M>, "is Frederick your slave ?”</DiaM>

<Dia>"I shall do it, she knows:"</Dia> — <Descriptor>and away he went, to do as he was bidden</Descriptor>. A little lecture ensued from mamma, on <FIDquotes>"speaking prettily;"</FIDquotes> with an explanation of penitence, and some general observations on humility of deportment.</SceneDia>

To her mother, Helena was a model of obedience — to others, most particularly to the domestics, if they ever ventured to find fault with her, she would sometimes stand <i>higher</i> than mamma thought becoming; but this pride brought on its own humiliation; for Mrs. Villiers never failed to oblige her to make concessions to all whom she had hurt or offended.
