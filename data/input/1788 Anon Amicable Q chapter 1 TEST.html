<ChapEpigraph>The laws of social benevolence require that every man should endeavour to assist others by his experience. He that has at last escaped into port from the fluctuations of chance, and the gusts of opposition, ought to make some improvements in the chart of life, by marking the rocks on which he has been dashed, and the shallows where he has been stranded.

<ChNameIntro>Sir Harry Hyndley</ChNameIntro> and his lady had long flourished in the most splendid scenes of fashionable magnificence. During twenty years they had graced the annals of matrimony by the best-bred dissension, which, fostered by acrimony and time, at length expanded into the most reputable species of conjugal and reciprocal detestation.<ChNameIntro>Lady Hyndley</ChNameIntro> was childishly fond of inordinate and frivolous pleasure; she was one of those common charaters who are never happy but in a crowd. Sir Harry, who had a person uncommonly fine, was a gross voluptuary, depraved in principles, riotous in enjoyment, without wit, without sentiment, without elegance. They had no children to promote fondness, or to check hatred. Separate companions, and separate pleasures, were the natural consequences of their polite alienation; and among the friends selected by Lady Hyndley as her favourites, she particularly distinguished a student of Oxford.<ChNameIntro>Sir Stephen Bruce</ChNameIntro> was an intimate friend of Sir Harry Hyndley, who was intrusted with the care of his son during the residence of Sir Stephen in Scotland.

The young man, therefore, passed every vacation, and every leisure hour, with Lady Hyndley. He received her attentions with gratitude, but gave no encouragement to those kindnesses which were lavished with more tenderness than propriety. Her ladyship was not old, but was yet <QuotedLit>"<i>touched by the tender hand of mellowing time.</i>"</QuotedLit> She was, perhaps, at that age indicated by Voltaire, when he says <QuotedLit><i>"L'amour est le plus grand des maux quand il n'est le plus grand des biens.</i>"</QuotedLit> The object of her partiality was placed next her in every company, with an ill-bred and rude preference of him to people of higher rank and unquestionable superiority. At table she always fed him with the nicest <i>morceaux</i>, culled with solicitous delicacy from the most exquisite dishes. He attended her to all places of public amusement, and to every private party, where, from his frequent appearance, he soon became an accustomed guest. This intimacy occasioned many hints and sneers; but the rigid propriety, and occasional coldness, exhibited by Bruce, whenever Lady Hyndley's friendship became too fervid, effecually prevented every other ill consequence but the displeasure of Sir Harry. Weary of conjectures, the truth of which they could not ascertain, the attentive friends of Lady Hyndley thought it necessary <DoxaQuotes>"<i>not to know what to think.</i>"</DoxaQuotes>

<ChNameIntro>George Bruce</ChNameIntro>, the son of Sir Stephen Bruce, was bred at Eton, and had studied at Queen's for three years. At the age of twenty-one he was entitled to a small independent fortune, left him by a relation of his mother. Lady Bruce was married when very young to Sir Stephen, who being of a disposition untameably ferocious, treated his wife with cruelty, and his son with oppression. They had little intercourse; for Sir Stephen denied his son that income to which his rank entitled him, and prohibited any correspondence between George and his mother.

<ChPortrait>The person of Bruce was formed with that happy mixture of masculine firmness and graceful elegance which a painter would choose for the representation of manly beauty: he was not slim, but was perfectly <i>arrondi.</i> His eyes dark, sparkling, and intelligent; his voice clear and energetic; his manners regulated by that invariable ease which is the charateristic of high-breeding. Though his intelletual capacity was uncommonly great, he was yet an eccentric mixture of romantic sentiment and volatile carelessness.

He was like Anthony, <QuotedLit>"<i>for his bounty there was no winter in it;</i>"</QuotedLit> and his munificence was not confined to the mere splendour of indolent donation, but was displayed in assiduous endeavours to serve and assist. One favourite propensity, the effect of a noble disposition, had often led him into ridiculous situations, by which he was exposed to the laughter of his acquaintance; this was the <i>enthusiasm of friendship</i>, which glowed in his heart with such uncommon rapture and such invariable philanthropy, that his whole study was to admire every one he knew of both sexes, and to bind himself to them by the strongest ties of inviolable attachment. Bruce had engraved upon his mind all those sublime and glittering precepts of poets and philosophers, which generally aggrandize sentimental effusion, and consecrate disinterested regard, without insuring or ce- menting any solid friendlhip. By an unwearied endeavour to serve and to oblige, he had attracted the admiration of many individuals who were incapable of stability in their resolutions, or suavity in their disspositions, and thus, by a pliant acquiescence, he had kept secure posseflion of their favour. Ever ardent to cultivate the goodwill of mankind, fearful of offending, and ambitious of possessing an unlimited ac\quaintance, he perhaps sometimes forfeited his dignity, and disgraced his abilities, by a blind submission to the <i>dictamina</i> of his companions.</ChPortrait>

Such was the man who by rigid censors was called the <i>minion</i> of Lady Hyndley, and whom Sir Harry would have been happy to repulse without injury or injustice. He doubted not but that he was a gallant suitor for his lady's favours, and therefore wanted nothing but due prowess to dismiss his guest. The excessive cordiality and politeness of Bruce rendered the attempt unsuccessful. He perpetually expressed such a regard for his host, such a high sense of the ties of friendship, that it was almost impossible to insult a man, who every hour exhibited in his behaviour new instances of amiable beneficence. Sir Harry at last apprehended, that since her ladyship was so hospitable, it might not ill become him to imitate her generosity with equal ardour. Previous, therefore, to Bruce's next visit, he gave orders for a chamber to be got ready, and preparations to be made, for the reception of a lady who had before frequently visited Lady H. <SceneQuasi>He went out the next morning, and returned in his carriage with a young lady, whose elegant deportment and animated beauty interested every one in her favour, and deprecated that aversion which all felt at this singular introduction. Sir Harry presented her to Lady Hyndley with there words; <DiaQ>"I must intreat that <i>you</i> will be as affectionate to your female friends as I have been. I introduce this lady to you as a woman I value <i>next to yourself</i>; I shall be happy to give our friend Bruce so agreeable a companion; his fidelity and attachment to our house deserve our best endeavours to make it agreeable to him."</DiaQ> Her ladyship felt the sneer, but prudently resisted the impulse to resent it. She received her new guest civilly, and, to the astonishment of every one, Miss Bryant was allowed by her own friends, and prevailed upon by Sir Harry, to remain some time in his family.</SceneQuasi>

<SceneDia>The next day Bruce arrived. He was, as usual, received with that prodigality of friendship, which he knew so well how to recompense and to retain; his anxious endeavours to please revived all those sentiments in his favour which had perpetually influenced the whole family; and such were his powers of exciting esteem, that even Sir Harry reproached himself for thinking with severity of so amiable a companion.

The intimacies of Bruce were formed upon principles very different from those which cement ordinary friendships. The faults, follies, and foibles of their acquaintance, are frequently the inducements which bring together people of a <i>gregarious</i> disposition and visitors who furnish ample food for censure and laughter are often received with open arms: Bruce, on the contrary, found in the slightest acquaintance some virtue or some recommendation; and he carried his reverence for their qualities to a ludicrous height. On all other subjects he conversed rationally, and sometimes elegantly; but as soon as the enthusiasm of friendship was excited, it overwhelmed his discretion, and clouded his perspicacity. <Trigger>When</Trigger> Sir Harry introduced him to Miss Bryant, with some forced encomiums on his high character for cordiality in friendships, Bruce readily quitted the beaten track of customary compliment, to launch out into his favourite subject. <Dia>"I have been often amazed, Mr. Bruce, at the number of your acquaintance; how do you manage to attach and to preserve so numerous a body of people? I think I have met with very few who are in possession of so many connections."</Dia> â€”- <Dia>"Very few, indeed, Sir Harry; I pique myself with some reason, I believe, on the wide circle to which I am allied; my present complement is - let me see-  Eighty - then, fifty Hampshire - six at Scilly - the privy counsellor's three aunts - fourteen - Ay, ay - the present complement is one hundred and fifty-three: to which add my nineteen intimates in Russia, whom I never saw, and you will not find me <i>very</i> destitute."</Dia> The company smiled, and Sir Harry was pleased with the amicable phrenzy: <Dia>"I wonder how you can endure some of the odd traits which I think you must occasionally meet with in some characters, and especially where neither your interest nor your pleasure is concerned."</Dia> - <Dia>"Pardon me, Sir Harry, I have not a single friend, but who possesses some valuable talent; even the most common acquaintance I acknowledge is dear to me by the superiority of some splendid merit; and I consider my integrity and judgment equally pledged for the discovery of his virtues."</Dia> - <Dia>"A discernment less than your's, Mr. Bruce, could never descry any real worth in your new friend Sir Dudley Drone, a man absolutely devoid of all ideas, and who seems born for no other purpose but to sleep: he neither gives nor receives pleasure; he is ignorant, indolent, and absent; in short, I never saw a man less <i>companionable</i>."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Ah! dear sir, you know not half his merits; he is neither passionate, arrogant, nor impertinent; he hears every thing which is said in every company with the most patient attention; he never raises your expectations of his abilities too high, and of course never disappoints you; so far from assuming any character which he is unequal to, I have passed a week in his society at his own house, and never heard him speak the whole time."</Dia> - <Dia>"'Pon my word, a most agreeable man ! Well then, there's another acquaintance of your's I once met, Bob Panic, who is "always plaguing people with fears for their health, <i>because he has not seen them so long</i>, though it often happens that he has dined with them the day before; the last time I encountered him he went through all the symptoms of gout, palsy, and pleurisy, to prove to me that I had got a bilious fever."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Sir, I hardly know a more excellent man than Bob Panic; his only failing is, that he distresses his own mind for the welfare of his friends, in which, perhaps, he a little resembles me; his anxiety if he does not often see you; his solicitude to suggest means for your being better than you are, even if you are ever so well; his caution in not suffering you to deceive yourself into an opinion of being in health because you look so, or feel so; and, above all, his power of magnifying every misfortune and every danger, that you may be quite prepared against it; there, Sir, speak a man a true friend, and I, who have so often experienced his bounties, must always reverence my good friend Bob Panic."</Dia> - <Dia>"You speak very highly of him, which is surely more than you can do of his brother-in-law Ned Schism."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Pardon me, I think him one of the most useful and equitable characters I know; he is famous for cementing those friendships which by some unlucky perverseness or misunderstanding have been separated; and his great merit is; that he never allows people who have quarrelled to meet with a view to reconciliation, till he has made all parties acquainted with the mutual asperity which both have exhibited in each other's absence; he has a noble memory and he is always able to relate, with incredible accuracy, the whole vocabulary of abuses and menaces which he has collected from either side, together with all the different shades of insinuation and figures of abhorrence: thus you see every one acts under reciprocal conviction and cannot again give way to the violence of their temper, with the salvo of having been trepanned into good will <i>under false pretences</i>."</Dia> â€”â€”

<Dia>"Well, Sir, these people have doubtless great recommendations, and they are much superior to another man, whose want of education and good sense would, I should apprehend, totally preclude an intimacy between you; I mean Peter Le Pied."</Dia> --- <Dia>"Bless me, Sir Harry, he is one for whom I have a very sincere regard, as well for his elegant accomplishments as for his manly virtues: Sir, he is the best dancer I know! he treads most learnedly; he cannot ask you how you do, but you may see he has been taught to dance! Even his mind, Sir, is always moving in an intellectual minuet; all the world know it; his fame might entitle him to a dancing diploma for opening every ball he goes to; and I doubt not but his minutest <i>pas</i> will reach posterity: then his temper is as flexible as his toes; he bows benevolently; there is a kind of probity in his mode of being true to the time whenever he exhibits: he keeps time so much better than--" "He keeps his word - which he will, I believe, break to his dearest friend, upon the most solemn occasion."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Sir Harry, we are not all perfect; and, I think myself bound by every tie of agility, to maintain the friendship of Peter Le Pied."</Dia> -- <Dia>"And pray, Mr. Bruce, give me leave to ask, Are the motives equally cogent which united you in friendship with Billy Tipple, the meagre toastmaster, who drinks three bottles in an hour?"</Dia> -â€” <Dia>"Certainly! It is not his intemperance that I admire; no, Sir Harry, it is his valour and fortitude; it is resolution exhibited upon many occasions, that shews him to be possessed of a genuine courage which marks the truly brave: my poor praises, however, would be faint, if you could once see him in his proper sphere, if you could view him glowing with natural ardour, and with unshaken firmness; for instance now, if you saw him take physic! Ah! Sir Harry, the prowess with which he swallowed two pilis and a saline draught! Never shall I forget, when struggling with a cold, which he got by shaving in a hard frost, how he spurned, with a generous indignation, the remedies of abstinence, which his great soul could not brook ! No, Sir, with that undaunted spirit which he may so justly boast, he encountered a sudorific potion of white wine whey; he then went to sleep, submitting for four hours and an half to the ignominious bondage of the bed-chamber: his fever abated; but his mind, Sir, was neither elevated by success, nor sunk by imprisonment; no longer, then, let us say with a malignant and narrow prejudice, that 

<QuotedLit>Heroes are much the same, the point's agreed,
From Macedonia's madman to the Swede.</QuotedLit>

Far be it from those who are illumined by the rays of Tipple's heroism; far be it from such to deny that a great mind may exist in a slight person: let every one disposed to carp at lofty deeds consult the annals of my friend Tipple's courage and conduct; let them remember his achievements, and gladly offer that portion of praise which is so justly due to the chevalier <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>."</Dia>

The novelty of Bruce's predominating enthusiasm afforded Miss Bryant infinite entertainment; but she saw, or thought she saw, in him something more interesting than the peculiarity which he then exhibited: this sentiment, whatever it was, she too studiously endeavoured to conceal. <ArrivalDeparture>When the ladies retired to coffee</ArrivalDeparture>, Miss Bryant noticed Bruce's frailty: <Dia>"What a ridiculous propensity! nothing so ill becomes a man as to proclaim the imbecillity of his own mind; the handsomest man in the world must suffer from so dark a shade in his character: no, I could never bear Mr. Bruce, even if he said or thought the civillest things of me."</Dia>

Lady Hyndley was struck with the brisk censure from a girl not of a satirical disposition. <Dia>"You are severe upon my friend, and really without reason, for I doubt not but he is sincere in whatever he says; and if you consider how valuable a true friend is, you will respect his zeal, and honour his fidelity."</Dia> -- <Dia>"I shall think much better of him, Madam, since he is so ably defended; and, like you, I shall make it no less my duty than my pleasure to <i>contemplate</i> his little peculiarities."</Dia> -- <Dia>"If you favour us with your company during his residence with us, you will have leisure for permitting Mr. Bruce to increase the number of his friends; and I presume you have no one in your family who would object to your knowing the world by studying characters."</Dia> -â€” <Dia>"Your Ladyship is little acquainted with me, and still less with my friends, if you suppose they would not be anxious on the subject of my usurping attentions, to which I have no claim: I shall seriously consider myself selected pointedly as the object of your ridicule and disapprobation, if you think I do not thoroughly contemn Mr. Bruce's affected raptures; and, whatever excellence you may see in them, nothing can be more remote from my disposition than to lend my praise to such empty sentiments."</Dia> -- <Dia>"You are the first person who has not seen something amiable even in his errors."</Dia> -- <Dia>"Dear Ma'am, I am not obliged to be watching every body's virtues; my own go very well, and can never want to be regulated by the dial of every moralist I meet."</Dia> -- <Dia>"But, why imagine that the dial is so incorrect?"</Dia> -â€” <Dia>"Not at all, Madam; he is very true, and tells how love flies, that is, if you shine upon him."</Dia>

<ArrivalDeparture>Bruce and Sir Harry came in.</ArrivalDeparture> The latter, who was an intemperate feeder, had drank inordinately. He reeled up to Miss Bryant. <Dia>"My dear Emily, rob me of my bottle, if I don't love thee; I do, 'faith ! I'll have some coffee; it shall be strong as your sense: I'll put milk enough in to make it as soft, and sugar enough to make it as sweet as your disposition."</Dia> Miss Bryant was much confused at his improper behaviour. Lady Hyndley coloured, and told Bruce, in a whisper, to persuade Sir Harry to behave with due decorum. <Dia>"Alas! Madam, it is the business of my life to make friends; judge then, if I can be so weak as to tell them when they expose themselves."</Dia> -- <Dia>"But, my friend, is there not some very gentle manner in which you, with your usual good sense, could convey a reproof?"</Dia> - <Dia>"Dear Madam, no good sense ever conveyed a reproof: I see Sir Harry is totally wrong, therefore the last thing that will cure him is a reprimand. If he was sober, and in the right, he might, no doubt, be easily persuaded to alter his conduct."</Dia> Lady Hyndley interfered, and at last prevailed upon Sir Harry to sit down and drink his coffee. <Dia>"Well, I will be persuaded and good-natured! 'Faith your ladyship looks very well to-night; how I should love you if you were not married ! hey, Lady Hyndley? â€”â€” Nay; don't blush now, for it looks as if you understood me, and that I dare say you would not do for the world; besides, I have such ideas of the sacred purity of women's delicacy, that I am shocked to see them renounce the smallest particle of it. - Ah! Emily, my love! well, how do all do at home ? Is Sir Edward pretty well, and Lady Bryant, and young Mr. Bryant? How do they all go on there ? What a pretty, nice, little creature you are, Emily! I dare say your mother is very fond of you. --- Now, Mr. Bruce, I have drank my coffee, let's all go and take a stroll to the Opera; come - let us - let us."</Dia>

The rest of the party declined it, considering Sir Harry's situation; he only darted a look of vengeance at his lady for preventing the expedition, and then went off himself. The evening passed very agreeably, from the mutual endeavours of Bruce and Miss Bryant to contribute to the pleasure of Lady Hyndley, who had just prudence enough to be pleased with her company, when it was her interest not to offend them; <Sententia>a species of discretion not always displayed by persons <i>apparently</i> much wiser than her ladyship: in the <i>charlatannerie</i> of self-conceit, those who aspire at superiority may, without any one requisite for a valuable character, without sense, wisdom, good-humour, or politeness, soar above their companions by petulant and solicitous disdain.</Sententia></SceneDia>
