<ChapMarker>CHAPTER I.</ChapMarker>

<SceneAction>TlME had nearly completed the tenth hour of a lovely autumnal evening in the year 1780; the moon was high in the heavens, and its beams were streaming widely over the magnificent scenery of the Rhine, and giving its boldest features in softened beauty to the passengers, in a boat which was pursuing its quiet course towards Strasburg. From the time of night, it might be inferred that haste or concealment, and not inclination or pleasure, governed the motions of the voyagers, who consisted only of two young gentlemen, with one attendant: <ChNameExternal>he who sat in the stern of the little vessel was a youth of eighteen; his easy carriage displayed all the self-possession of rank and consequence; but though the lines of pride might be traced in his countenance, they were not yet deeply indented there; for its predominant expression was blended gaiety and mischief, which sported in dimples on his cheeks, and played about his mouth; his manners were still those of a boy, but he displayed, in a superlative degree, the freedom and quickness of action which indicate that sort of decision of character emanating from self-will, as if he would say with Almanzor — <QuotedLit>"Know that I alone am king of me."</QuotedLit> This was Hermann, the only son of baron von Frankendahl, at that period ambassador from the Elector Palatine to the court of France.</ChNameExternal> <ChNameExternal>On the left hand of Frankendahl was seated a tall and elegant young man, of five or six-and-twenty, with regular features, fine dark eyes, and a countenance which expressed habitual observation and reflection; he was wrapped in a roquelaure, and a brace of carabines and a sword were lying beside him; and this was Beverley Nugent, the confidential secretary of the ambassador just named</ChNameExternal>: a formal, sly-looking, elderly valet, commissioned by the baron to attend his son, and three bargemen, completed the group.

Young Frankendahl was playing a thousand nonsensical tricks, such as paddling with an oar, bathing his dog, much against its will, and immersing his hands in the water, which he contrived to throw upon the bargemen, when their attention was directed another way. Nugent sometimes smiled at his fooleries; and when he deemed them to be verging too far upon either danger or mischief, he checked him by a firm yet respectful remonstrance. At length Hermann struck up the following little air, and his companion, starting from his own meditations, joined in it with all the vivacity of youth and cheerfulness.

<QuotesOther>"How delightful to roam, 
O'er the hills of my home, 
At the hour of op'ning day;
With gun and with hound, 
Over rocks to bound,
Where the fleet-footed chamois play;
When the sun's bright beam,
On the mountain-stream,
Like the brilliant eye in a lover's dream,
Mimics the diamond's ray!"</QuotesOther>

The concluding lines were bandied from one to the other, in deepened tones and a higher key; and so near was the boat to the right bank, that as echo bore the strain around, it was caught up by a party of vintagers, returning to a hamlet on the skirt of the Black Forest: the boatmen joined in the chorus, and all parties contrived to keep it up with loud vociferation, until the peasants were out of hearing.

Noisy and boisterous mirth is sure to be followed by exhaustion and silence. Frankendahl was fain to sit quiet, and to amuse himself with watching the shadows of the hills and rocks on the water, while his lungs and voice recovered their tone; and Nugent, with all the liveliness of fancy, and ardour of hope, congenial to the spring-time of existence, was building castles in the air, and weaving magic webs for many anticipated years of health, and happiness, and distinction, and glory; his thoughts were of when he should visit other countries, dwell in the courts of the different princes of Europe, and turn to advantage the political knowledge and experience he had already acquired: nor did he contemplate those desired results, without reflecting on the means by which they might be attained; he had favourite plans, more than one; but they were half-formed, vague, and indeterminate, and as yet only floating on the surface of a very vivid imagination: he had been educated in the strictest maxims of moral probity, and young and romantic, he flattered himself that he should always be able to continue what he was — at once a courtier and a man of honour, to use the term in its most extensive acceptation: but youth is sanguine, and would deem it possible to climb a glacier without falling, or to gather roses without feeling the thorns of their stems.

The little vessel now pursued a noiseless course; the rapid tide needed not the use of oars; the steersman sat silent at the helm, and the active spirit of Frankendahl was yielding to the soft influence of sleep: they were within two leagues of Strasburg, <Trigger>when</Trigger> the dash of oars, as if a boat was putting off from the shore, broke on the silence and in the next moment those sounds were mingled with the low moans of distress, uttered in a human voice, which seemed to be impeded by something being bound over the mouth, or forced into it.

Nugent, now aroused to surprise, alarm, and attention, looked forwards, and, aided by a dear beam of moonlight, beheld a very small boat, rowed by two men, who, when they perceived our party, of whose approach they had not been aware, hastily attempted to regain the bank.

Though no person but these two men was to be seen, the boat evidently contained another, for the moaning was repeated, and it could not proceed from either of them, for they were quite alert, and visibly striving to elude observation: but Nugent was now near enough to reconnoitre them, with some degree of precision, and saw that one of them was habited like a waterman, while the other appeared to belong to a superior class, at least in point of dress.

The two boats were now nearly side by side. — <DiaM>"Holloa! who goes there?" <M>cried one of the watermen; to which the others only replied by augmenting their efforts to reach the shore;</M></DiaM> but the person who uttered the sounds of distress, now finding that there were people within hearing, strove effectually to make himself heard.

<DiaM>"Stoblitz, you scoundrel! what are you about? — are you going to commit murder?" <M>exclaimed <ChNameIntro>Joseph</ChNameIntro>, the bargeman who spoke before; and while he uttered these words, he and Nugent succeeded in grappling the little vessel.</M></DiaM>

Frankendahl was now roused from his slumber, and comprehending what was going forwards, seized one of the carabines, to assist and defend his party. In the same moment the ruffian, who has been already described as making the best appearance of the two, drew out a pistol, and levelled it at the head of Nugent.

With the quickness of lightning Hermann fired his piece; so did the assassin, but with more erring aim, for the ball of the former entered the shoulder of the villain, while his passed under Nugent's arm, and fell guiltless in the water.

The strong moonlight now enabled our party to ascertain that the man who uttered the accents of distress lay bound in the bottom of the boat; and the wounded ruffian, uttering the most dreadful imprecations, nOw sunk down beside him.

The small vessel seemed already so deeply laden, that no one durst venture to go on board; but the watermen threatened Stoblitz, the other miscreant, that if he offered to prevent them from towing it to shore, they would throw him overboard.

Nugent, prompted by compassion for the sufferer, who seemed fainting, and incapable of making further appeals to their pity, and Frankendahl, influenced by some feeling of humanity, and much of curiosity, joined in urging the boatmen to use speed, and in giving them every assistance in their power; while Albert, Frankendahl's valet, by the direction of his master, stood sentry over Stoblitz, and ensured his submission by keeping a loaded carabine pointed to his head.

The boats were soon brought to the bank, at the foot of the small village of Russberg, which was then, and perhaps is still, notwithstanding the numerous exchanges and transfers of territory which have taken place in those parts, in the dominions of the duke of Baden.

The moment it was practicable, the two young men flew to the assistance of the suffering stranger, and found their conjectures right: a handkerchief was bound over his mouth, and his hands and feet were secured with cords; they quickly removed the bandage, but the sufferer was unable to speak, nor did he give any sign that he was sensible of the efforts they were making to serve him.

Frankendahl thought him dead; but Nugent hoped he had only fainted, from the united effects of terror and want of air. He was a tall and stout man, well dressed, and appeared to be far advanced in life. Hermann and Beverley attempted to raise him, but bis weight was such as to render the task beyond their strength.

<DiaM>"We have arrived too late, Nugent," <M>said Frankendahl</M>; "the poor old gentleman is done for."</DiaM> He then called Albert to their assistance, and they made the horrid discovery that the stranger's pockets were filled with stones; and the only inference which could be drawn from that circumstance was, that the wretches in whose power he was, were about to throw him alive into the river, when their dreadful purpose was so providentially defeated.

The moment Albert ceased to stand sentry over Stoblitz, the latter made an effort to run away; but the boatmen soon perceived, and arrested his intention; and those cords with which he had so lately and so basely fettered the limbs of another, were now destined to do the same office on himself.

Immediate assistance was, on many accounts, absolutely requisite; but though the village and its inhabitants were well known to the watermen, a considerable time elapsed before a sufficient number of them could be roused from their deep repose, for it was now near midnight. By the time some of the peasants arrived, Frankendahl and Nugent had succeeded in restoring their patient to animation; but he was unable to speak — groaned deeply, and evidently suffered great pain. Amongst the group assembled near the boats was <ChNameIntro>Ludwig, the aubergeste of Russberg</ChNameIntro>, and his son-in-law, who was a fisherman; those persons immediately recognised the suffering stranger to be general Colville, an English gentleman, who inhabited a retired cottage, in a beautiful little village called St. Severine, on the north-east border of Lorrain; and on examining the features of the wounded ruffian, Ludwig discovered him to be the personal attendant of the unfortunate gentleman.

There were now a sufficient number of assistants, both to take care of the sufferer and to secure the villains. So far as those two points were concerned, Frankendahl and Nugent were therefore at liberty to pursue their route to Strasburg: but though the claims of humanity were in some degree satisfied, those of justice were not so. Frankendahl had wounded one of the ruffians, whether mortally or not, remained to be ascertained; and though the act was justifiable, that point must be proved by testimony before the competent authorities, before he could be suffered to quit the vicinity; neither could the evidence of Nugent and the watermen be dispensed with; so that all idea of finishing their voyage was, for the present, abandoned; and when the boat was secured, the baggage taken out, and general Colville, and the bleeding villain and his fettered accomplice, conveyed to the inn, Beverley, Hermann, Albert, and the bargemen, proceeded thither also.</SceneAction>

The hamlet did not afford any surgical practitioner; but it was ascertained that a professional gentleman was that night lodged at a neighbouring convent. Thither a messenger was dispatched, and Nugent employed the interval in writing to baron Frankendahl a detail of the circumstances which prevented Hermann and himself from pursuing their journey, taking care to gratify the paternal feelings of the baron, by an animated and indeed just eulogium on the intrepidity displayed by his son. He knew that his patron would be chagrined at this delay: he had not seen Hermann for upwards of two years, and the chief purport of Beverley's journey to Germany, was to conduct this young gentleman to Pans from the university of Mayence, where he was a student; but his mission had also objects of a political nature to accomplish, and it was concerning these alone that he regretted the loss of time which would take place, because he knew they required expedition, and this was why they were thus expediting their journey in an open boat.

<SceneAction>Nugent's letter, and a much more brief one from his gay companion, being concluded, the two young men turned their entire attention to their patient and their prisoners. General Colville now occupied the bed in the only retiring-room which the house contained; the wounded and captive ruffians were laid upon straw, in an out-house, under a guard of peasants; and the rest of the party, that is to say, Prankendahi, Nugent, the valet, the landlord, his daughter, her husband, and the boatmen, assembled in the kitchen to await the arrival of the surgeon, and of the <i>amt-mann</i>, or rural magistrate, whose residence was about a mile distant, and to whom a peasant had been dispatched, to make a statement of the case.

Dorothea now displayed the combined fare of her larder, dairy, and cellar —- sausages, eggs, milk, and <QuotedLit>"bread of the coarsest sort, and meager wine,"</QuotedLit> all of which the travellers were quite hungry enough to enjoy. In the intervals of eating, much conversation was carried on concerning the incidents of the night; many conjectures were formed; and Frankendahl and Nugent, in answer to their questions, were told several anecdotes of Stoblitz's villany; he was a boatman of the neighbourhood, and all united in giving him a very bad character. Ludwig stated, that general Colville had been several times at his house, on his way to and from Baden, and other places in the vicinity, describing him as a gentleman of respectability and honour, said to be rich, and by all acknowledged to be generous.

<DiaM>"What family has general Colville?" <M>asked Nugent</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Only himself and his wife," <M>replied the landlord</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"He has no wife — at least none here," <M>said Francis, the fisherman</M></DiaM>.

<DiaM>"Who was that handsome lady who was here with him one day then?" <M>questioned Ludwig.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Dare say that was his daughter," <M>said Dorothea.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"No, she is his niece," <M>rejoined Francis.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Dare say thou's wrong," <M>said his wife.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"No, I have heard her call the general uncle more than once, when I have been at St. Severine with fish," <M>returned Francis; and the assertion of course concluded this part of the colloquy.</M></DiaM>

Nugent was now impatiently expecting the arrival of the surgeon. -— <DiaM>"Is he a person of skill?" <M>he asked, but without a hope of having the question satisfactorily answered; for he supposed that those ignorant peasants had the same confidence in a wandering quack that savage tribes place in their conjurers.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"He is a right good doctor, sir, and does many wonderful cures," <M>replied Ludwig.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>Ay, father, but I never like to see him," <M>said Dorothea,</M> "for I am sure he is a magician, and works with the black one, for all his cures are against nature, as one may say."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"How is that?" <M>asked Beverley, smiling</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Why, when Francis had the fever, you know, the natural way would have been to keep him warm; but he made me open the window, and take off the blanket, and —- "</Dia>

<DiaM>"Well, well, he soon set me on my feet again," <M>interrupted her spouse.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ay, but he has dark dealings," <M>rejoined Dorothea, shaking her head </M>: "there was when he lived whole six months beside Heidelberg, they say he would never let any living soul come into his house all the time, but spoke to every body out of the win --"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Beside Heidelberg!" <M>said Nugent, with some emotion; then seeing the fisherman about to speak, he suddenly checked himself, and seemed to wait with anxiety for what he might say.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Because he was always busy with chemistry matters," <M>he exclaimed</M>; "he can make phosphorus, and sal-ammoniac, and ---" <M>Then, after a pause, and with a grin, and in a half-doubting tone, he added</M> — "They say he can make gold too."</DiaM>

Frankendahl listened with visible interest to this latter intelligence, and was about to ask some questions, when Dorothea again opened her mouth to speak, and his native politeness yielded precedence to a female. She availed herself of this tacit permission, and informed the company that father Gerard said the doctor was an Englishman, and a heretic.

<DiaM>"An Englishman!" <M>repeated Nugent, in a voice and manner which betrayed the most intense interest.</M> "What is his name?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Zedsyake," <M>replied Francis.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Sedgelake! Good Heavens!" <M>said Beverley, speaking to himself.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Do you know him, Nugent?" <M>questioned Frankendahl, with quickness.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have seen him formerly," <M>Nugent replied</M></DiaM>; but Hermann, not quite satisfied with this laconic answer, and either not comprehending, or not heeding that his friend might mean it as a hint that he did not wish to be more explicit before so many strangers, was about to pursue the subject, when the sound of — <DiaOther>"The doctor, the doctor! here is doctor Sedgelake!"</DiaOther> drew all eyes to the door, and none with more eager scrutiny than those of Beverley Nugent. But their expression was not that of either fear or vexation.

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER II.</ChapMarker>

<ArrivalDeparture>Ludwig received doctor Sedgelake</ArrivalDeparture>, and lighted him in, with many profound bows, and much display of ceremony. <ChPortrait><ChNameIntro>Sedgelake</ChNameIntro> was a middle-sized, well-looking man, robust for his height, and, in point of age, a little on the junior side of sixty; his appearance was entirely that of a gentleman, and his dress a suit of French grey cloth, made according to the fashion of that period; he wore a bag wig—ruffles at his wrists—and boots; but when he was a pedestrian, which was often the case, the latter were exchanged for shoes, with massive silver buckles; and a gold-headed cane was substituted in place of his horse-whip. In early life he had been a surgeon in the British army, from whence, at the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, he retired on half-pay: he was qualified for his profession, by abilities, and education, and experience; but soon after his retirement from active life, he had the misfortune to fall from his horse, by which accident he received a slight concussion of the brain: from that time his conduct was marked by much eccentricity, and his temper became so irritable, that he was frequently roused to anger by the slightest contradiction. He led a wandering and unsettled life, visiting many different countries: to Germany, the scene of his youthful campaigns, he was very partial, and sometimes remained there for several months together. He cherished many whimsical opinions and peculiar notions: his obstinacy was invincible; and to the highest respect for his own opinions, he joined the most open contempt for those of others. Such were his foibles: but he was by no means destitute of good qualities; his honour and probity were unimpeachable — he was capable of very sincere friendship — and was ever ready to dedicate his skill to the service of the poor and unfortunate. Though now declining into the vale of years, neither toil, nor travel, nor exertion, could subdue the hardihood of his mind and his frame; his habits were active, temperate, and courageous; and when he was with society he liked, he could render himself a very pleasant and agreeable companion.</ChPortrait>

When Sedgelake entered the kitchen of the inn, his eyes rested first on Nugent, which was not to be wondered at, for his figure and appearance were beyond all question the most commanding of any there; a look, in which surprise, evident precognition, and pleasure, were blended, rose on the features of the doctor. Nugent advanced eagerly; but the expression of Sedgelake's countenance changed, and turning somewhat abruptly away, he requested to be shewn in to his patient.

Beverley felt hurt, for more reasons than one: this was a meeting which he had long ardently wished for; but beyond that, he saw that Frankendahl comprehended that he and Sedgelake were previously known to each other — that Albert, the valet, whose prying curiosity he greatly disliked, was sedulously watching him — and that they both looked surprised, when Sedgelake so palpably shunned his advances. To be the object of such scrutiny is very painful to a mind of refinement; and conscious that he had no cause to shrink from acknowledging that he knew this man, he again stepped forwards, and said, in his own graceful and winning way — <DiaQ>"Doctor Sedgelake, I believe I have before had the pleasure of seeing you?"</DiaQ>

Nugent expressed himself in French; and Sedgelake, as if now first recollecting him, replied, in the same language - <DiaQ>"Ah, Mr. Nugent, yes; we have met at Heidelberg. I am glad to see you, sir," <M>and as he spoke he presented his hand in the English mode </M></DiaQ>; and Frankendahl, who, on points which pleased himself, was quick-sighted and observant in the highest degree, saw that he gave that of Nugent a particular préssure, as if <QuotesDoxa>"more was meant than met the ear."</QuotesDoxa> Sedgelake, however, precluded all farther animadversion or conjecture, by turning his whole attention to the situation of general Colville: the landlord and Nugent attended him, and Hermann took care not - to be left out of the party.

Francis was watching by the bedside of the general, who frequently groaned deeply, and appeared to suffer great pain. The surgeon felt his pulse, and examined his head, while Nugent and Frankendahl watched his every motion, the former from the genuine impulses of humanity, which had deeply interested him for the suffering Englishmen — the latter chiefly from a desire to see and comprehend whatever was going forwards. The doctor's report was, that his patient had received several severe bruises on his head, and different parts of his body, but that no bones were fractured; and though he was certainly very ill, and would probably for some time feel the effects of the cruel treatment he had received, still, if no inward hurt manifested itself, of which he yet saw no symptom, he trusted that care would eventually restore him. He then proceeded to take a proper quantity of blood from the sufferer's arm, and to bathe his hurts with vinegar, while Hermann and Beverley assisted him with gentle kindness, for their education in German universities had made them sufficiently acquainted with surgery, to know how to be of service on such occasions.

General Colville was so far revived by the operations performed, and by the assurances pressed upon him by his young friends, that he was safe, and amongst those from whom he would receive every attention, that he recollected what had happened to him; and though he conversed with great pain, he succeeded in explaining that he was on his return home from Baden, when he was assaulted, beaten, and robbed by his servant, a Frenchman, in whom he had placed great, and it now appeared, unmerited confidence. This brief statement left many points to be elucidated, but Sedgelake prohibited his patient from talking any more at present; and a composing medicine being administered, and Frankendahl's servant stationed by general Colville's bedside, he was left to repose.

The surgeon next turned his attention to Debrett, the wicked servant, who had been wounded by Frankendahl. At Nugent's request, Hermann refrained from being present at this examination; the ball had lodged in the shoulder, from whence Sedgelake soon extracted it; nor did he apprehend any danger, except from fever; and there was no doubt that if his judicious prescriptions were attended to, that would be kept down. Beverley himself carried this report to his friend Hermann, who felt glad that he had not been the executioner of a fellow-being, however little he merited to live.

General Colville was, as may be supposed, too ill to make any deposition before the <i>amt-mann</i>, who had by this time arrived, but he took those of Frankendahl, Nugent, and their people; which done, as the case was of a description which claimed the attention of a higher tribunal, he laid a detainer upon the whole party until the following day, when it was, he intimated, his intention to come, supported by a proper force, to conduct them all to Baden. Sedgelake smiled to see that the petty magistrate took it for granted that his patients would be well in a few hours; however he did not offer any comment, except to say, that neither on the following day, nor for several days yet to come, would either general Colville, or the prisoner, be in a state to bear removal to Baden</SceneAction>

The morning had dawned long before all these matters were brought to a conclusion; neither Nugent nor Frankendahl had much inclination to seek repose; but the surgeon insisted that they should do so; and as Francis and Dorothea possessed a cottage near the inn, it was hastily put in order for their reception — that is to say, if the term orderly may be applied to a place from whence cleanliness and neatness were in a great degree exiled; as to Sedgelake, he returned to the convent, where he was lodged, saying he should come back to the village by eleven o'clock.

<SceneDia>Hermann was one of those jovial spirits, who find, or make acquaintances wherever they sojourn: when Beverley sought him to go to their room, he was found in deep discourse with Francis the fisherman. <Trigger>When they had got to their apartment</Trigger>, and were bolted in, secure from interruption or intrusion, Frankendahl said — <DiaQ>"I have been asking Francis about that strange mortal doctor Sedgelake."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Well, and what does he say of him?" <M>questioned Beverley, with some degree of interest.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Oh, he tells a thousand odd stories; but you appear to know the doctor, Nugent; have you met him in your own country?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"No," <M>replied Beverley; and then, after a short hesitation, he added</M> — "I saw him some years ago at Heidelberg."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I thought you might wish to have some conversation with him, and so I kept out of the way," <M>resumed Hermann.</M></DiaM>

Nugent had indeed solicitously sought a few minutes' conversation with Sedgelake, who had as carefully avoided giving him any opportunity: there was a bluntness in Frankendahl's manner, which looked as if he had penetrated into the wishes of his friend, and was now plainly fishing for information: some persons, situated as Nugent was — a dependant on baron Frankendahl, might have thought that his son was presuming on the difference of their stations, to pry into his affairs; but though he had not known Hermann long, he had seen enough of him to be convinced that whatever might be his faults, neither malice nor ill-nature were in the catalogue; indeed it was easy to see that he was already much attached to Beverley — that he admired his talents — and that he would have made him his model of imitation, had not his levity and love of mischief too frequently interposed to draw him off from that and every other laudable pursuit. Baron Frankendahl had married an English lady; she was long since deceased, but her son was enthusiastic in his admiration of Britain, though he had never seen it; and nothing so strongly awakened his curiosity and interest, as persons and circumstances connected with the British isles. He believed Nugent to be an Englishman; and Beverley, though he never ratified the belief in words, had tacitly assented to it. This unexpected meeting with Sedgelake would, he felt, call upon him to be more explicit, or otherwise leave room for indefinite suspicions; by Frankendahl's express desire, all ceremony had been banished from their conversation during the few days they had lived together, and Nugent now replied to the last words of Hermann.

<Dia>"Indeed, Frankendahl, I did wish for some conversation with this man, but think he purposely avoids giving me ariy opportunity of speaking to him;"</Dia> Here Beverley paused.

Hermann heard him attentively, and seemed waiting to see if he would add more; when he found that his friend did not pursue his discourse, he said — <DiaQ>"If he will hot talk to yourself, he will to others about you; he has been asking our boatmen and old Ludwig if you seemed to have known general Colville before, or if you displayed any interest about him, beyond what humanity might be supposed to dictate."</DiaQ>

Nugent reflected a moment, and then replied — <DiaQ>"These questions could only arise from his knowing me to be a countryman, or at least a fellow-subject of general Colville's; but I think it would hâve been more candid, and more in the line of a gentleman, to have inquired of myself, than of those people."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"So I think," <M>said Hermann, and then added</M> — "when he first came in, it was evident that he knew you; and while we were assisting him to bleed general Colville, he seemed to be attending to your looks and motions much more than to his lancet; so that I was really afraid he would open an artery instead of a vein, and send the poor old gentleman to the other world, after all the pains we had taken to keep him in this."</DiaM>

Here Frankendahl ceased speaking, and Nugent remained lost in anxious thought; after a short pause, the former said, promptly — <DiaQ>"Did you know this Sedgelake in England, Nugent?"</DiaQ>

Though Frankendahl could not possess the shadow of a right thus to reiterate a question which his companion had already answered, the latter felt that if he hesitated in his reply, it would seem as if he dared not to avow when and where his acquaintance with Sedgelake commenced; beyond that, his mind was fraught with matters of deep interest to himself, and he could not resist the present opportunity of unburthening it: under other circumstances, he would not, perhaps, have chosen so giddy a confidant as Hermann Frankendahl; but besides that it would be unwise to incur suspicion, <Sententia>it is natural for the oppressed spirit, when the pressure is not that of guilt, and sometimes even when it is, to pour its cares into the first ear that will listen to them.</Sententia>

In answer to Hermann's question, he replied, with blended earnestness and emotion — <DiaQ>"I could not know doctor Sedgelake in England, for I never, to my knowledge, lived there."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Never lived in England!" <M>cried Frankendahl, in the most lively astonishment</M>; "how I have misunderstood you! but your name is English — are you then a German, descended from British parents?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No, I am not a German," <M>returned Beverley</M>; "I was born in some part of the British dominions, but where, I cannot say; I believe this doctor Sedgelake knows not only that circumstance, but every thing else connected with my history, and it is on this subject, which is one of such intimate concernment to myself, that I wish to converse with him."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But what induces you to think that Sedgelake knows more than yourself?" <M>questioned Frankendahl</M>: "did you never know your parents?" <M>he added, in a tone of commiseration.</M></DiaM>

Nugent replied — <DiaQ>"No; I have been told I am an orphan, and very likely it may be so; from my earliest remembrance, I lived in the house of a clergyman at Nant Davy, a small village situated in the county of Flint, in North Wales; there I grew up to the age of fifteen, as ignorant, as awkward, and as happy as I could possibly be."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"That you were happy I do not doubt," <M>interrupted his young friend;</M> "but that you were either awkward or ignorant, could never be the case."</DiaM>

Nugent received this compliment <Sententia>as we usually do flattery, in whatever shape it comes</Sententia> — that is, with a secret thrill of pleasure, a half-curbed smile, and a negative shake of the bead. - <DiaInset1P>"What I tell you is true," <M>he resumed</M>; "my acquirements were all on a demiscale: for instance, when I was taught Latin, I was left so unacquainted with history, as not to be certain whether or not a nation existed in which that language was still spoken; and as to personal appearance, you never saw such an unformed cub as I was. However, at the age of fourteen, I began to comprehend that there was a world beyond the Welch mountains, and to wish for a peep at it. I soon made my wishes known to Mr. Hughes, the clergyman with whom I resided, and on whom I felt myself to be entirely dependent. He answered, that it was time enough to talk of such matters; and I went about, moping and pouting, for nearly another year, when one morning Nant Davy was thrown into a commotion of wonder and astonishment, by a report that a Frenchman was at the village inn; for the people amongst whom I was reared invariably suppose that every foreigner is a Frenchman. The stranger soon made his appearance at the parsonage, where he produced letters, money to settle accounts, and, in short, every credential authorizing Mr. Hughes to transfer me to his care, saying, that he was going to take me immediately abroad, to complete my education. I heard Mr. Hughes ask him whither; but he evaded the question."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaM>"But who did the letters and money come from?" <M>interrupted Hermann</M>; "if you were entirely dependent on Mr. Hughes, how was that?"</DiaM>

Nugent replied — <DiaQ>"I did not fail to make the inquiry, both of Mr. Hughes and of this gentleman; but they evaded the question."</DiaQ>

Beverley then proceeded to speak of his departure from Wales — <DiaInset1P>"I shall never," <M>he said,</M> "forget my feelings of that day, though I cannot analyse nor describe them. I had ardently desired to see the world; but now that I was about to leave, perhaps for ever, the quiet home, which was the only one I had ever known — when I saw Mrs. Hughes in tears, packing up my linen — and when the boys wrung my hands, and exhorted me to write to them — and the girls hung about me, pressing their needle-cases and smelling-bottles on my acceptance as keepsakes, oh, how I wished that I could remain at Nant Davy, still to dress the garden, and look after the sheep on the hills! And my worthy, revered friend too — I shall never forget the kind, paternal way, in which he blessed me. — <DiaM>‘Never depart from the path of right, my dear boy,' <M>he said</M>; 'and then, if you should, at some future time, return to this country, rich and happy, you will not scorn our humble abode; and should Providence order it otherwise — should you come back, poor and afflicted, you shall ever find a welcome and a shelter beneath its roof.'</DiaM>"</DiaInset1P>

The eyes of Nugent glistened at once with animation and tenderness, as these cherished remembrances rose to his mind; while Hermann, who was cast in a mould far less refined, and who had never known other feelings, nor other ideas, than those connected with prosperity, and the gratification of every wish, yawned, partly from drowsiness, partly from inattention, and said —  <DiaQ>"Well, but Sedgelake — you have not yet told me what you know of him?"</DiaQ>

Nugent resumed — <DiaInset1P>"Then, not to tire you, my dear Frankendahl, with a tedious story, my conductor had come from Chester, the nearest town, in a post-chaise, and we continued that mode of travelling across the country to Yarmouth, a town on the opposite coast. The novelty of such a conveyance, the wonders I saw, and the voyage to Hamburgh, soon made me — no, not forget my Welch home; that, I trust, I shall never do — but I thought of it with less regret. From Hamburgh we travelled to Heidelberg, where my temporary guardian, who called himself Halle, bade me adieu, and I have not seen him since. At Heidelberg I remained seven years, under the especial protection of professor Linhagen, a man dignified with the most exalted virtues of our nature. As my mind expanded, I became desirous of information on many points, which, in the thoughtlessness Of early youth, and in the seclusion of Wales, had passed by unheeded; but on none so much as those which concerned my relative connexions. I seemed cut off from all affinity with my fellow-mortals, and yet my every want was supplied, as if by magic; not only was every expence attendant on the usual course of academical studies, and on my prolonged residence at the university, defrayed, but I had masters in drawing, fencing, and dancing; and —but I am again becoming prolix.

"Professor Linhagen was kind to me, beyond what my ardent gratitude can ever find terms to acknowledge: when I had been about three years at Heidelberg, and instead of being removed to my own country, as I had expected, was given to understand that I must remain considerably longer, I ventured to ask him if he knew in what part of Britain I was born, and whether I had any existing connexions. I shall never forget a word of his reply - <DiaM>'Indeed, my good Beverley,' <M>he said</M>, ‘I am almost as ignorant on this subject as yourself; but, as I am not bound to secresy, and human life is uncertain, the little I do know I think it right to communicate to you. About three months before you were brought to Heidelberg, an English surgeon, whose name is Sedgelake, an old acquaintance of mine, and a man, of whom it is difficult to say, whether the merits or peculiarities of his character predominate, requested me to receive under my patronage a British youth, who was, he said, nearly related to a very particular friend of his, who, for family reasons, wished him to finish his education on the Continent, and eventually to fix his abode there: he added, that if I acceded to the proposal, I should annually receive a sum which he named (and which is amply sufficient for every purpose of your residence here), through the medium of a banker at Hamburgh, who was well known to me: more copious information, he said, it was not in his power to give, having passed his word of honour to make no further disclosure. I could not offer any objection: you arrived, my good Beverley, and the pecuniary part of the contract has been faithfully performed; but I have not since seen Sedgelake, nor has any communication whatever, in which you are concerned, been made to me.'</DiaM>

"Such, Frankendahl, was M. Linhagen's intelligence: I could now only hope, that time might again bring Sedgelake to Heidelberg, as from him alone could I receive any elucidation of the obscurity in which I was involved. <SceneQuasi>Two more years had passed over, when one day, the professor sent for me to his apartments: on my entrance, I found a stranger there, but how did my nerves thrill, and my heart beat with expectation, when the very man we have seen to-night was introduced to me as doctor Sedgelake! We are all sanguine, and ready to hope that what we wish, will come to pass: I persuaded myself that Sedgelake had arrived on purpose to make me the desired revelation — perhaps to take me with him to England, to the bosom of my family. He accosted me with much kindness of manner, and questioned me on my improvements, of which he was, I soon found, well qualified to judge. After some time had passed in conversation on different topics, he produced two beautiful English gold watches, and tendered them to the acceptance of M. Linhagen and myself, as tokens of remembrance from my guardian, in England.</SceneQuasi>"

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"Is that elegant watch you wear, one of them?" <M>interrupted Hermann.</M></DiaInsetInterruptionDia>

<M>Beverley replied in the affirmative, and proceeded to say</M> — "<SceneQuasi>I could not resist the opportunity of asking, and I am sure I did it with great emotion, whether that guardian was related to me; but Sedgelake answered promptly, though I cannot say he did so in an unfeeling manner, that it was quite out of his power to make me any communication on the subject; and that I should best consult both the wishes of the gentleman he alluded to, and my own interest, by restraining all curiosity on those points. This passed in the presence of M. Linhagen, and it was the only satisfaction I could obtain. After some further discourse, Sedgelake dismissed me, with a polite hint, that he had business to transact with his friend the professor.</SceneQuasi> I retired, and to my equal surprise and disappointment, I afterwards found that he quitted Heidelberg almost immediately; and from that day, I have never been able to meet with him, until accident has brought us together this night."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaM>"Then, if I was in your place, I would take care not to let him go away again without giving me some information," <M>cried Hermann, earnestly</M>; "maybe he is related to you himself, or perhaps the guardian he mentions is cheat-ing you out of a fortune, and keeping you here, for fear you should find it out."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No, no," <M>returned Nugent</M>; "the high character for integrity which professor Linhagen gives Sedgelake, will not allow me to cherish that supposition; however, I believe that his reason for shunning me to-night is a fear that I will renew my former inquiries."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But," <M>cried Frankendahl, with quick recollection,</M> "you know the fisherman's wife said that Sedgelake once lived six months beside Heidelberg, and would let nobody come into his house; did you not see him then? or did he do that for fear you came to ask him any questions?"</DiaM>

Beverley replied — <DiaInset1P>"I know he lived some time beside Heidelberg, but that was after I quitted the university: M. Linhagen wrote me word he had been there; and added, that nothing further in which I was concerned had transpired.

"I should have told you, that when I was about twenty-one, the professor received a letter from Sedgelake, to announce that it was my guardian's pleasure I should now choose my plan of life. I had hitherto devoted myself to jurisprudence, in which faculty M. Linhagen was professor; and I was given to understand, that I must either obtain permission, through the heads of the university, to practise law in the dominions of the elector palatine, or accept such a situation as might offer in one of the German courts; adding, that I should receive, through the medium of the Hamburgh bankers, an annual pension of one thousand rix-dollars. Without hesitation, I chose the line of politics, both as being most congenial to my taste, and as that which will afford me the best future chance of visiting other countries, especially England, whither I am resolved one day to go."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaM>"And so am I," <M>interrupted young Frankendahl, with something like ecstacy in his manner</M>; "we will go together; and when we are in England, you know it will only be to find out who are Sedgelake's connexions, and then you will be enabled to trace your own. I would not be deterred by him from endeavouring to find them; every body here agrees he is crack-brained."</DiaM>

Nugent replied — <DiaQ>"He does not exactly deserve to be called so: M. Linhagen told me he had a fall, which partially injured his head; since which his judgment has been warped on some particular points, chiefly those which are incidentally connected with his profession; but his general conversation displays much acuteness of intellect and knowledge of mankind."</DiaQ>

Here Nugent paused, and Frankendahl, in a tone half asleep, inquired — <DiaQ>"Well, what more?"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"I have nothing to add," <M>returned Beverley</M>, "but to apologize for so long detaining you from rest, and to say, that professor Linhagen added to the many obligations he has conferred on me, that of an introduction to the patronage of your noble father."</DiaM>

Hermann was not so drowsy but that he could rejoin — <DiaQ>"For which I owe the worthy professor my best thanks, since it has obtained for me the pleasure of your friendship;"</DiaQ> and in the next minute he was asleep; but many meditations, connected with the review he had been taking of his own circumstances, long kept his friend Nugent from rest.</SceneDia>

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER III.</ChapMarker>

<SceneQuasi>The sun, now high above the Swiss mountains, was decorating the landscape with the brightest and most brilliant tints of autumn, when Nugent, with a mind tranquillized and a frame refreshed, awoke from his short repose. He addressed a few words to his companion, but received no answer — <FIDambig>Frankendahl had vanished</FIDambig>.

Sedgelake had said the preceding night, that he would be at Russberg by eleven o'clock, and as Beverley, on consulting his watch, found it to be already past ten, he rose without delay, that he might make inquiries after general Colville, and see what was become of Hermann; for he was not without some degree of self-accusation, for having indulged in sleep so long, and suffered him to go out unaccompanied.</SceneQuasi> When he entered the inn, he was told by Ludwig that the young baron had gone upon the river, with Francis and some others of the watermen; and this intelligence did not tend to lessen his vexation and anxiety; he blamed Hermann much for stealing away, and himself more, for not having watched him with greater vigilance while under his immediate care, knowing, as he did, how giddy he was, and how great was his propensity to mischief: he ordered coffee for himself, and a boat to be prepared, that he might send Albert to Frankendahl, with a request that he would return immediately, and then went to general Colville's room.

<SceneDia>The effect of doctor Sedgelake's opiate was not yet dissipated; the patient was still asleep; but Albert said he thought his rest would not last much longer.

Nugent dispatched him on his errand, and seating himself by general Colville's bedside, contemplated his striking countenance: he could not be less than seventy; his hair was silvered; and the lines of time and reflection were on his forehead; but it was there alone that age seemed to have set her seal; his frame was still robust, and his teeth entire; and on his right cheek was a deep scar, the honourable badge of a soldier.

Beverley thought he would soon awake, and <ArrivalDeparture>when Dorothea came on tiptoe</ArrivalDeparture> to announce that the coffee was ready, he requested her to bring it in, cherishing the hope that the general would find himself sufficiently refreshed to partake of it. She soon returned, and either the effect of the medicine was over, or the noise made in placing the table, dispersed it, for general Colville started, and opened his eyes. Nugent bent anxiously forwards, so that his youthful countenance was the first object the general beheld. He gazed on him earnestly, yet with visible wildness of manner, and exclaimed — <DiaQ>"My Maria!"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Dear heart, he calls on the Virgin," <M>said Dorothea.</M></DiaM>

Nugent suffered her to think so; but he knew, from the manner in which the words were spoken, that they were not intended for a Catholic invocation. Some one had said, the preceding evening, that general Colville had a niece; and Beverley supposed that, in the first bewildered moment of returning recollection, he had mistaken him for her.

"<DiaM>How do you feel yourself, my dear sir?" <M>said Nugent, in English.</M></DiaM>

His voice seemed to dispel the illusion, and again starting, as if from a dream, Colville exclaimed — <DiaQ>"Where am I?"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Safe, and amongst friends, sir, who will pay you every attention," <M>replied Beverley.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"I remember it all," <M>he exclaimed</M>; "my villainous servant was about to murder me, when some one came to my rescue, and fired on the assassins: to you then, generous, noble young man, I owe my life;"</DiaM> and as he spoke he stretched out his hand, and fervently pressed that of Nugent, who modestly replied — <DiaQ>"No, indeed, my dear sir, I was only one, and not the most active, of your deliverers; it was a young German nobleman, with whom I travel, who so bravely fired on, and disabled your infamous valet; and the men in whose boat we happened to be at the time deserve every praise for their activity, humanity, and courage."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"May Heaven reward you all!" <M>cried Colville, fervently</M>. "You, I see, are my countryman. But where is your brave companion?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"My friend, who will be here by-and-by, is the son of baron von Frankendahl, the Palatinate ambassador at Paris," <M>returned Nugent: then reflecting that, by styling Hermann his friend, he was assuming an equality with him, and that when the subordinate sphere in which he moved came to be explained, he might incur the imputation of a paltry vanity, he added, with the same modesty of manner</M>, "I am his excellency's secretary, a native of Britain, but educated abroad."</DiaM>

<ArrivalDeparture>Dorothea had now quitted the room,</ArrivalDeparture> to proclaim that general Colville was able to speak; and Nugent, pouring out a cup of coffee, assisted him to take it. The effort of doing so made him sensible of his hurts, and consequent pain and weakness; and he felt that he would be unable to leave his bed. At his desire Nugent described the whole transaction of his rescue, the mode in which the surgeon had treated his case, and the cognizance which the law had already taken, and was further to take, of the affair.

On this point general Colville had nothing to say, but that he was ready to await the course of justice, according to the laws of the country he was then in. He professed himself perfectly satisfied with the care and skill of his doctor; and with respect to the situation in which he had been found by Nugent and his friends, he now entered into a detail of circumstances, to the following effect.

<Backstory>General Colville, together with bis niece, had been for some weeks past at Baden; the efficacy of the warm baths of Germany constituting his chief motive for residing at present on the Continent; they had left the cottage at St. Séverine in charge of a neighbouring peasant, and were attended at Baden by two favourite domestics—this Debrett, who had proved himself so undeserving of confidence, and Eleanor Fosbrooke, the personal attendant of Miss Colville. A letter from England» respecting a remittance of money, which had been delayed much beyond its Hue time, rendered it necessary that general Colville should go immediately to Strasburg. It was late in the evening when he quitted Baden, attended by Debrett: he travelled along the bank of the Rhine, until it became requisite to cross the river, when yielding himself too implicitly to the direction of his treacherous servant, he was led, under pretence of finding a boat, to a secluded spot, where he was assaulted and robbed by Debrett and Stoblitz, and finally gagged, bound, and forced into the small boat, loaded, as already described, with heavy stones, for the declared purpose of being thrown into the water.</Backstory>

<DiaM>"I had resigned myself to die, though I confess not willingly," <M>said Colville, with great emotion</M>, "when it pleased Heaven to hear my prayers, and to send you and your gallant companions to save me."</DiaM>

While general Colville was making these explanations, <ArrivalDeparture>Sedgelake entered the room</ArrivalDeparture>; the wonted salutations of the morning were exchanged, and were succeeded by those questions and answers between the doctor and his patient, which the case of the latter required. General Colville, in very polite and flattering terms, expressed his thanks for the skill and attention which had so far restored him, and then said, with a pleasant; smile — <DiaQ>"Though hitherto, doctor Sedgelake, we have been unacquainted, I am no stranger to either your talents or merits. Perhaps you are aware of my relationship to your friend Mr. Ponsonby?"</DiaQ>

Sedgelake bowed in acknowledgment that he was aware of it; but so far as Nugent was enabled to translate his countenance, it exhibited a shade of displeasure, or uneasiness, or some feeling of that class.

General Colville resumed — <DiaQ>"Are you recently from England, sir? Have you been in Cumberland lately?"</DiaQ>

Sedgelake only replied to the latter question. — <DiaM>"No, sir, I have not." <M>He then added</M> — "I heard, by chance, a short time back, that our friend is in his usual state of health."</DiaM> He then immediately changed the discourse, by asking general Colville what amount of property the robbers had taken from his person the preceding night?

<DiaOther>"About twenty-five pounds in money, a gold watch and seals, and a valuable ring," <M>was the reply.</M></DiaOther>

Nugent said that M. Frankendahl's valet had them all in his possession; adding, with a smile — <DiaQ>"With his wonted formal tenacity, he is resolved to retain them, until he delivers them up to the magistrates at Baden, having taken them himself from the pockets of Debrett."</DiaQ>

Colville next told his visitors that there were two points on which he must beg to trespass on their kindness: — to write to his correspondent at Strasburg a few lines, which he would dictate; and to procure some person to go to Baden, and apprise his niece of what had occurred - <DiaM>"I know what my dear girl will feel on my account," <M>he said</M>, "and I am anxious that she should be assured I am not so ill as her fears will perhaps represent me."</DiaM>

Nugent immediately offered himself as general Colville's amanuensis to write to Strasburg: he would gladly have extended his politeness, and waited in person on Miss Colville at Baden; but his time and actions were not at his own disposal; he could neither leave his charge of Frankendahl, nor quit the village of Russberg, until every form of justice was complied with.

Sedgelake appeared to reflect a short time, and then said, that himself would write what general Colville should dictate, and add his own assurances that his patient was doing very well, and would be able to go to either Baden or St. Séverine in a few days; and that he would in the afternoon dispatch a peasant, on whom he could rely, to Miss Colville with the letter.

These offers were accepted with cordial gratitude; and writing materials being produced from Nugent's travelling escritoire, the two gentlemen sat down to write their respective epistles, when <ArrivalDeparture>Dorothea burst into the room</ArrivalDeparture>, pale, trembling, and exclaiming — <DiaQ>"Oh dear, oh dear, the poor young baron!"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"What is the matter?" <M>cried Nugent, in wild alarm.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh dear, oh dear, the black one has been at work — it is the black one's agents!" <M>and her eye gknced fearfully on Sedgelake</M>; "I thought so — I said so last night!"</DiaM>

The surgeon saw her looks directed to him, and cried angrily — <DiaQ>"What did you say last night? What ails you, woman — are you mad?"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Oh no, sir — no indeed, good sir, I am not mad!" <M>returned Dorothea, shrinking in wild affright, as all the coercive measures pursued in cases of madness rose to her imagination, and combined themselves with the fear that Sedgelake would administer them.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"For the love of Heaven," <M>reiterated Nugent</M>, "tell me what has occurred? Has any thing happened to M. Frankendahl?"</DiaM>

Dorothea threw herself on her knees before him, and raising her clasped hands, cried — <DiaQ>"My husband was not to blame, sir — indeed he was not."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"To blame for what, good woman?" <M>asked general Colville</M>; "pray explain yourself:"</DiaM> but Dorothea, instead of answering to the purpose, still kept pleading to Nugent on her husband's behalf, and exonerating him from some implied, or supposed, or possible censure.

Beverley's worst fears now embodied themselves, and the horrid picture of poor Hermann drowned, the agonizing grief of baron Frankendahl, and his own unavailing remorse for having suffered his charge to stir from his sight, all took forcible possession of his imagination; he attempted to rise, that he might ascertain the dreadful truth, but Dorothea held him fast, shrieking — <DiaQ>"Do not punish Francis — do not punish Francis; it was his young grace himself who ordered him to go."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"To go where, fool?" <M>roared Sedgelake.</M></DiaM>

Dorothea, intimidated by his manner, tamely answered — <DiaQ>"On the river;" <M>but in the next moment she recovered her energy, and cried</M> — "It was Francis who took his grace out of the water; evil betide them that conjured him in."</DiaQ>

Whether Sedgelake had any previous idea that he passed in this part of the country for a conjurer, or how he would have behaved under this broad hint that he was so, cannot be ascertained; for now that Nugent found his dreadful apprehensions confirmed, he would not longer be restrained, by the weak hold of Dorothea, but breaking away, <Blend>he rushed to the kitchen</Blend>, followed by Sedgelake; <Exclamation>and oh, how delightful was the relief poor Beverley experienced, when the first object he saw was Hermann himself, standing near the fire-place, dripping with wet indeed, but apparently suffering no other inconvenience!</Exclamation> When he saw Nugent enter, he turned to him, with a smile, exclaiming — <DiaQ>"See, what a pretty figure I am! in stepping carelessly out of the boat, I fell into the river; and if it had not been for this brave fellow," <M>pointing to Francis</M>, "I might have been drowned."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"My dear Frankendahl," <M>returned Beverley, in a tone of remonstrance,</M> "why did you go out this morning?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"To get a little sport, to be sure; I saw you were fast asleep, and so I would not disturb you."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Well, hasten to put off your wet dress, and go to bed," <M>interrupted Nugent.</M></DiaM>

Ludwig was all this while disrobing Hermann, and Albert was preparing dry clothes; but as to himself, be seemed as little concerned as if nothing had occurred. — <DiaM>"You see we are taking off the wet things as fast as we can," <M>he replied</M>; "but as for going to bed, there you must excuse me; I am going to pay my respects to general Colville — I have not seen him yet."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You must not only go to bed, young gentleman, but you must have a warm bath, and lose a little blood," <M>said Sedgelake.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"No, thank you, my dear sir," <M>returned the incorrigible Hermann</M>; "as for a bath, I have had water enough for one day, that you must allow; and, as to being bled, you doctors think it right to be sure; but I never saw any very good effect produced by boring holes in people's veins."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You are a headstrong boy!" <M>vociferated Sedgelake, irritated by this contradiction.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Headstrong! headstrong! headstrong! that is strange language, doctor Sedgelake — such language as, under such circumstances, I should not tolerate in any man but yourself; but your age, which I venerate — your country, which I adore — your usefulness to general Colville, which I take into due consideration — your friendship for -"</Dia>

Here Nugent saw that in his giddy volubility he was about to betray to Sedgelake, that he had confided to him the mysterious kind of connexion which subsisted between them; and as he had every reason to believe that Sedgelake would resent his having done so, and perhaps to a greater extent than he was aware, he hastily interrupted Hermann in his harangue, by saying, with solemn earnestness — <DiaQ>"M. Frankendahl, my dear friend, in your father's name, suffer me to entreat that you will immediately go to the room where we slept, and retire to bed for a few hours."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Let him die," <M>vociferated Sedgelake, in violent anger</M>; "he deserves nothing else."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh fie, doctor," <M>he carelessly replied</M>; "now I am quite dry and snug, I will just warm my hands a little, and then visit general Colville."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ay, you will be warm enough tomorrow," <M>cried Sedgelake, sarcastically</M>; "if you neglect the proper precautions, you will be in a high fever by that time."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You disciples of Galen are patent prognosticators," <M>was the reply.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"M. Frankendahl," <M>said Nugent, with visible discomposure</M>, "I see you are resolved to distress me."</DiaM>

<Dia>"No, indeed, I have not yet formed that resolution, whatever I may do hereafter; and to convince you of it, and solely to please you, I will lie down for an hour; but none of your warm water and bleeding for me. — Doctor Sedgelake, your most obedient;"</Dia> and with a profound bow <ArrivalDeparture>he quitted the room</ArrivalDeparture>, attended by his servant, while Sedgelake loudly vociferated — <DiaQ>"Headstrong boy — and obstinate stripling;"</DiaQ> then addressing himself to Nugent, he said — <DiaM>"Now we will go and finish the letters for general Colville, and then you and I will dine together in the arbour in the garden, where we will sit cool and pleasant, and free from interruption."</DiaM>

Beverley heard this with delighted astonishment; for as Sedgelake was in such a gracious mood, he flattered himself that it was his intention to take the present opportunity of making some disclosure.</SceneDia>

The letters were soon dispatched, and a young peasant, recommended by Ludwig, stationed as an attendant on general Colville. Nugent then went to his room to arrange his dress, and to see how Hermann rested; and Sedgelake visited the wounded ruffian, for the bailiff was waiting his report. Debrett was too ill to be removed; of course he was suffered to remain where he was, under a proper guard; but Stoblitz was conveyed to the prison at Baden.

<SceneDia>Nugent, to his great satisfaction, found Frankendahl asleep; he took especial care not to disturb him; and when his toilet was completed, he repaired to his appointment with Sedgelake, in all that agreeable thrill of spirits which we usually experience, when assured that an anxiety which has long harassed and oppressed us is about to terminate.

The arbour in Ludwig's garden was composed of rustic trellis-work, over which a flourishing vine spread its exuberant tendrils, its rich clusters making their way through the interstices of the osiers, and presenting themselves on the inside of the bower; some beautiful flowering shrubs were entwined with the vine, and though now almost bereft of their luxuriant flowers, a few still lingered in autumn, to attract the bees, who hummed in concert with the birds, singing blithely amongst the branches, and the murmuring of the village brook, as it meandered at a distance: these rural cadences sweetly interrupted the silence of the scene, and accorded well with the calm and tranquil quiet of one of the loveliest days of the season.

In this pleasant retreat Nugent found his friend Sedgelake seated — the table spread for their repast — and his arrival the signal for bringing in the viands. Ludwig came prepared to wait; but Sedgelake gently dismissed him, saying — <DiaQ>"We are travellers, my friend, and are too hungry to use much ceremony; general Colville is an invalid, and may require some of your attentions."</DiaQ>

Ludwig bowed and retired; and the doctor then said to his companion — <DiaQ>"We shall feel much more comfortable, and more at liberty by ourselves; we can make an English meal of it, converse without restraint all the while, and carry on the discourse in our own language."</DiaQ>

Nothing could be more agreeable to Nugent than all this; it seemed as if the wish, which for so many years had been the most cherished one of his soul — that of being made known to himself, was about to receive its fulfilment: he began the conversation by saying — <DiaQ>"I made an excursion from Manheim to Heidelberg about a fortnight ago, my dear sir, and had the happiness to find our revered friend quite as well as ever I saw him."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"I am glad to hear it," <M>returned Sedgelake, with a brightening aspect</M>; "I do not know a more worthy man than professor Linhagen."</DiaM>

His companion warmly reiterated this praise, and inquired whether Sedgelake had lately seen the professor?

<DiaM>"No," <M>he replied </M>; "I only landed from England about a week ago; my meeting with you here is very unexpected indeed."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Which renders it the more agreeable to me, my dear sir — like whatever of pleasure comes unlooked for," <M>returned Beverley, in his own graceful way.</M></DiaM>

If Sedgelake was much flattered and conciliated by this implied compliment, he did hot suffer it to appear in his countenance, but said, after a short pause, as if continuing his own discourse - <DiaQ>"And this meeting with Colville is a strange coincidence."</DiaQ>

These few words could not fail to excite Nugent's curiosity; but he took all possible care not to display it in his looks, while he replied — <DiaQ>"You and general Colville seem to know each other, through the medium of a mutual friend, sir."</DiaQ>

<Dia>"Yes: did he tell you who that friend is? —- did he ask you any questions about me? In short, what did he say to you before I came in this morning?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Not a syllable in which you are concerned, I do assure you, sir," <M>returned Nugent, no longer able to suppress a glance of astonishment</M>. "I do not suppose he had the least idea that it was you who attended him, until he saw you, and heard me mention your name."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Perhaps not; but though I have said it is a strange coincidence, I could not be surprised, when I understood from the man who came for me last night, that it was Colville I was called to; for I was aware of his being in this part of Europe. But hear me calmly, Mr. Nugent, when I give you a solemn admonitory caution, on no account to make known to general Colville the ignorance you are in respecting your family and connexions; never let him know where you were brought up; but beyond all, beware of saying that I have been your delegated guardian, or of owning any acquaintance with me, beyond the present accidental meeting in this house, and on the present occasion. You were, I saw, surprised and hurt last night, that I wore the appearance of being a stranger to you; but I did so for most cogent and powerful reasons."</Dia>

<DiaM>"But why, Mr. Sedgelake," <M>cried Nugent, no longer trying to suppress either his surprise or emotion</M> — "why is it, that if those reasons concern me, I am kept in ignorance of them? I can have little inducement surely to acquaint general Colville, or any one else, that I am in the mortifying and humiliating situation of an unacknowledged alien. Does general Colville know my relations? Has he reason to dislike them? Would he be my enemy? Is he not the man of honour and respectability he appears?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Those questions, Mr. Nugent, are needless and useless; it rests not with me to answer them: I have long since told you, that I am bound to be silent on your subject; but I will traduce no man — I will injure no man; I believe general Colville to be a brave officer, and a worthy individual. Only remember my caution, and let the matter drop."</Dia> 

With this injunction Sedgelake paused; but Nugent's bursting heart could not entirely stifle its regret and disappointment, at thus finding all hope of information barred; nor could he refrain from making one more effort to move the inflexible doctor — <DiaM>"I must obey you, sir," <M>he said</M>; "and you will do me no more than justice, by believing, that in my obedience is included sentiments of very high respect for you; - but I have no one else in the world to unbosom myself to — no one else to whom I can say how ardently and anxiously my soul pants to be owned by a relative being — to see some one in whose veins kindred blood flows — who has an interest in my fame, because it is a family bond — who would shed a tear for my sorrows, and bestow a smile on my joys."</DiaM>

Here Beverley hesitated, for his feelings were too powerfully awakened to proceed. Sedgelake too was affected, more so than he chose should appear; he took time to smooth down his aspect to its wonted philosophic dryness, and then replied — <DiaQ>"You are young, Mr. Nugent, and attach more importance to those things than they merit: the man who is surrounded by a tribe of relations, is not always the happiest; one tugging at his purse, another provoking him by his folly, and a third, who has made himself infamous by his vices and crimes, including him in the family disgrace; no, no — all those matters are wisely ordered by a directing Power, whose workings we see only in their effects. You are placed in a very honourable line, my dear Beverley; and at your age, if you make a proper use of your advantages, and shun those rocks which too many young people split upon — I will be plain with you, I mean dissipation and indolence — you may do much, you may acquire useful knowledge, and secure valuable friends; and thus, whatever pinnacle of fame and distinction you reach, it will be doubly glorious, inasmuch as the merit will be solely your own, and owe nothing to ancestry; and who knows but that hereafter Beverley Nugent may be the founder of a family, which will amply supply to him the want of those relations he has never known." <M>He spoke the last words with a smile, and barred all rejoinder, by changing the topic, and reverting to his dinner:</M> "I abhor their vile cookery in this part of the world," <M>he said</M>; "this meat is done to tatters, and so oleaginous, that it is absolutely detestable: this hash, intended I suppose as an apology for a ragout, is at once luscious and subacrid; I hate such a hotch-potch: in short, there is nothing palatable but those little dumplings."</DiaQ>

Nugent could see very well, that though Sedgelake would not, or perhaps could not give him the information he wished for, yet sympathy for his wounded feelings had in reality deprived him of appetite, while, to hide his emotions, he was thus laying the blame on the culinary skill of Ludwig and Dorothea; and his gentle nature was so grateful for this instance of kindness, that he rallied his spirits, and exerted himself all he could to amuse and enliven his companion.

Dinner was ended, and the cloth removed, but the bower was so pleasant, that the two friends had no inclination to quit it; in smoking and conversing on different topics, they wore away the time: amongst other things, Sedgelake said — <DiaQ>"I wish those dilatory fellows would take our depositions, and have done with this tiresome business, that you might be at liberty to pursue your journey; but this is the land of slowness in every respect; pity that Justice is not spurred on by habeas corpus, as she is with us. If Colville really wishes to punish his infamous servant (and I think that for the good of society he ought to do so), he must expedite her motions, by applying a little of that metal, which never fails in its effects, otherwise we may all stay here longer than any of us can calculate upon."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Oh, surely," <M>cried Nugent</M>; "no government on earth will be slow to punish premeditated murder."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ay, so I thought at your age; I believed that justice was every where impartially administered; it was amongst the last of my prejudices that I gave up," <M>returned the doctor, drily </M>; "and now the next thing we may expect is this — that obstinate lad, Frankendahl, will be ill, and unable to give evidence; so here you may be detained, Heaven knows how long."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I hope not," <M>returned Beverley.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"He cannot escape," <M>cried Sedgelake</M>. "I never saw such a perverse fro ward being; you will see he will be very ill tomorrow, but it is only what his obduracy deserves."</DiaM>

Here a noise amongst the branches behind him made the doctor turn round, when he met the laughing face of Hermann, peeping into the arbour. Sedgelake at first looked rather confused, and then very angry, while Frankendahl advanced with an unembarrassed bow, and <DiaOther>"your servant, gentlemen;"</DiaOther> then throwing himself on a seat, and looking calmly up at Sedgelake, he added —- <DiaQ>"You see, my dear doctor, I have been destined to verify the English proverb, that 'listeners never hear a good tale of themselves.'"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"No wonder," <M> Sedgelake, with blended ill-humour and irony</M>: "he who descends to the meanness of listening, cannot merit much praise."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Now really that is a harsh charge," <M>cried the incorrigible Hermann</M>; "pray permit me to exonerate myself from it. I was just coming, in pure good nature and friendship, to join you, when I heard my own name mentioned; and as you might be descanting on my merits, for any thing I knew, I could not in modesty come in, until I was certain whether or not that was the case. You see how the most innocent actions may be misconstrued;" <M>and he shook his head, and sighed with such mock gravity, that Nugent with difficulty refrained from laughing.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Do you see what a mist is rising from the river?" <M>said the exasperated Sedgelake</M>; "you will dearly repent this folly; I should not wonder if you get a fever."</DiaM>

Nugent now earnestly besought him to return to bed, or at all events to go into the house; but Frankendahl calmly took up a pipe, and applied it to his lips. — <DiaM>"I am going in" — <M>puff, puff, puff</M> — "to offer my respects to general Colvine."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Not to-night, I hope," <M>said Beverley.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"To be sure I am" — <M>puff, puff</M> — "if he is awake."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You are worse than distracted to smoke tobacco, when you ought to be doing every thing to keep down, not increase, the febrile tendency," <M>exclaimed Sedgelake, at the same time forcibly taking away the pipe, while Hermann made an effort, though it may be supposed not a very earnest one, to retain it.</M></DiaM> Nugent felt seriously uneasy, certain that Sedgelake was right, and that Hermann was acting very imprudently. To remonstrate was, he saw, in vain; and as he was going to bid general Colville good-night, and Sedgelake to make his inquiries before he departed to his convent, they quitted the garden, as the only means of inducing their ungovernable companion to go within doors; so to general Colville's chamber <Blend>they all repaired together.</Blend>

Neither the doctor's report, nor the account which the patient himself gave of his feelings, left any room to doubt that he was doing as well as possible. He received young Frankendahl with every display of gratitude and politeness, expressed his regret for the accident which had befallen him in the morning, and hoped he was entirely recovered from its effects. This served as a signal for Sedgelake to expatiate, which he did at some length, but not much to the praise of Hermann's docility. Colville gently blamed his neglect of himself, and added, with a smile — <DiaQ>"If he will not be more obedient, I will punish him, for I will tell him no news of his friends in England."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"What friends, my dear sir?" <M>questioned Frankendahl.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Lady Halford," <M>said general Colville, enjoying his surprise.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Do you know my aunt Halford, the sister of my dear mother?" <M>said Hermann, with a brightening aspect.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"I know lady Halford and your pretty little cousin perfectly well. — Go to bed now, my dear young friend, and take care of yourself, and to-morrow I will tell you all about them."</Dia>

This did more than the united expostulations of Nugent and Sedgelake could effect; and before the latter departed to his convent, he had the satisfaction — if indeed he considered it one, after Frankendahl's behaviour — to see him take the gruel which he ordered.</SceneDia> Hermann took care, before he went to sleep, to question Nugent as to whether the doctor had made any communications, and when answered he had not, but that on tire contrary he persisted in asserting that it did not rest with him to do so, he strongly expressed both surprise and disappointment. — <SpeechInsert>"I am sure, Nugent," <M>he exclaimed,</M> "if I were in your place, I would not so tamely submit to be kept in the dark: if you will give me leave, I will ask him."</SpeechInsert>

It needs scarcely be told that Nugent declined all such interference, and exhorted him to secrecy as to what he had confided to him; while the injunctions Sedgelake had given him respecting general Colville, and the fact that Colville and Sedgelake had some previous knowledge of each other, he took care to conceal from Frankendahl.
