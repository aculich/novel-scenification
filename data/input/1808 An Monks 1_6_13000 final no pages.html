<SceneAction><DiaM>"Hark!" <M>said Manfredi, vaulting into his saddle</M> —- "hark! the screams are again renewed, and in the same direction."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Methinks," <M>added Rudolpho</M>, "they now seem nigher than before: and, had we but a gleam of moonshine to light our way through these dreary wilds, we should soon reach the distressed object that utters them."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Come light, come darkness," <M>replied Manfredi</M>, "let us at all events spur on; and, for the issue, trust to Heaven and the goodness of our horses. Who knows but our late miraculous deliverance was the work of Providence, to make us instrumental in punishing ruffian guilt, and rescuing oppressed innocence?"</DiaM>

So saying, he spurred on his steed to a full gallop; nor was Rudolpho less eager in the pursuit. <Metaphor>Rapid as the lightning's blaze</Metaphor>, they rushed on at a venture through brakes and thickets, and fancied they could now plainly distinguish the shrieks of a female in distress —- when Manfredi, dashing in full career against the extended arm of a spreading oak, was suddenly struck from his horse, unperceived by Rudolpho, who, from the superior fleetness of his courser, had left his hoary friend far behind; while Manfredi's steed, disencumbered of his burden, and following the sound of the other's feet, continued his course, regardless of his fallen rider.

The oak, that had caused this disaster, grew on the extreme verge of a yawning precipice, into which Manfredi rolled as he fell; and would have infallibly been dashed to pieces on reaching the bottom, had not the brambles and bushes, that clothed its craggy sides, broken and alleviated his fall. He was stunned, however, by the shock, and lay for a while bereft of sense and motion.

Coming at length to himself, he called aloud on Rudolpho: but Rudolpho, now far distant, heard not the voice of his friend; nor was other answer returned to his cry, than the name of Rudolpho, again and again reverberated in loud echoes from the rocks around.

<Monologue>"Perhaps," <M>said he</M>, "Rudolpho has met with a similar accident to mine! -— perhaps to him it has proved fatal! or -- equally dreadful —- perhaps his courage has spurred him on to dare with unequal force a ruffian band, too powerful for his youthful arm to quell! —- Would to Heaven he were here safe with me, or that I were by his side, wheree'er he be!"</Monologue>

At these words, he groped about for his shield: but his shield was not to be found. His trusty sword however still clung to his side, and his armour was uninjured by the fall. Inspirited by this fortunate circumstance, and concluding his horse either killed or gone astray, he resolved, on foot, and encumbered as he was by his ponderous mail, to make the best of his way toward that quarter whence the shrieks had assailed his ears, and where he was sure of finding Rudolpho, if yet alive.

He listened eagerly with attentive ear, to catch the sound again: but, all around being now silent as death, and not a star twinkling in the dark concave of heaven to direct his steps, he was uncertain what course to steer.

<Monologue>"Then Providence be my guide," <M>said he</M>, -— "that Providence, who has safely conducted me thus far, and so opportunely extended her saving hand to break my fall!"</Monologue> -— So saying, he advanced a few paces, when he found his progress stopped by opposing rocks that forbade his advances in that quarter. He turned to the right -— he turned to the left -— he tried in various directions: but, wherever he tried, he found equal impediments; and, as far as he could judge in the dark gloom of midnight, he was immured in a pit not more than twenty or thirty paces wide, hemmed in on every side by an impenetrable barrier of almost perpendicular rocks.

Manfredi possessed a soul not easily to be dis-spirited by obstacles. Difficulty and danger had no other effect on his courage and resolution, than that of raising it to a higher and yet a higher degree. He therefore coolly determined to search for some spot where he might climb the precipice, and free himself from his prison. He made repeated attempts in various parts of the surrounding rocks: but his efforts were vain.

Fatigued, exhausted with his unavailing struggles, he sat down, resolved patiently to await the approach of day, which would more clearly show him the nature of his situation, and enable him to extricate himself from it. His thoughts, meanwhile, were turned to the fate of his friend Rudolpho, whose courage was equal to his own, but not yet tempered by the prudence of age and experience. His imagination represented him rushing furiously to the charge, surrounded by numbers, struck perhaps by some coward hand from behind —- fallen -— fallen at the very moment of his arrival in his native country -— after their wonderful escape from the galling chains of barbarians, and their late miraculous deliverance from the murderous daggers of banditti.

Fired with the idea, and forgetful of his present situation, Manfredi started up: -— he grasped and half unsheathed his ponderous faulchion —- when suddenly the thick body of clouds, that darkened the vault of heaven, permitted the moon to dart, as by stealth, a feeble momentary ray o'er the dismal scene.

Transient as was the gleam, it enlivened Manfredi's heart, dispelled his gloomy reflections, and disclosed to his eyes a part of the precipice less difficult of access than any he had before attempted.

The sight now braced his aged nerves with all the vigor of youth: elate with hope, he sprang forward to the spot, where Heaven itself seemed to have pointed out the path for his deliverance; his mind strongly impressed with a conviction that Providence, notwithstanding his late disaster, was only conducting him by unforeseen ways to the achievement of some great and glorious deed. Big with this idea, and determined to exert his every effort in seconding the views of Heaven, he firmly grasped the roots and brambles which here and there shot forth through the clefts and crevices of the rock; and, forgetful of his age, he clambered with considerable toil and danger, till at length, about midway between the valley below and the brow of the precipice, he reached an eminence, where sitting down to take breath, and looking around if perchance he could discern any object through the dark veil of night, —- he saw, or fancied he saw, a glimmering light twinkle through a crevice in the rock.

Not daring to trust his eyes, he at first imagined it was one of those fleeting vapors, which, imbibing the electric flame from the surrounding atmosphere, and lightly sporting on the wings of air, oft mislead benighted travelers, and allure their unwary steps to rivers, fens, and pitfalls, where, instead of the hospitable door, they find an untimely grave yawning to receive them. He looked —- he rubbed his eyes -— he looked again: -— still the light appeared immovable in the same spot.

<Monologue>"Strange," <M>said Manfredi</M>, "that, if so near the haunts of men, neither my voice, nor the louder accents of the echoes that inhabit these rocks and joined their friendly notes to mine in calling on the name of Rudolpho, should have attracted any notice! -— At all events, whether men or infernal fiends inhabit the place, in the name of the blessed Trinity, I'll examine whence proceeds this light."</Monologue>

At these words, he devoutly marked his forehead and breast with the sign of the cross; and, brandishing his naked sword, advanced with conscious courage toward the light, which he soon found to issue from a considerable distance within the body of the rock, through a long narrow cleft almost choaked up with briars and brambles. He looked forward into the opening, and strained his eyes in eager efforts to discover what objects were within: but, from that distance, it was impossible to explore the mysterious recesses of the mountain. He resolved therefore to continue his dangerous route up the side of the precipice, and try if, by some other avenue, he might not be able to approach the spot whence the light proceeded.

Accordingly he prepared to climb to the summit: but here he was again disappointed; the spot on which he stood being overhung by vast masses of rock, so steep and impracticable, as to bid defiance even to the approaches of the mountain goat: and he was convinced, that to descend again to the bottom, and try another ascent in a different quarter, even if the attempt were not attended with such imminent danger, would only be a fruitless expenditure of time and labor.

Finding the place utterly inaccessible, under present circumstances, except through the narrow passage where he had discovered the light, he determined to penetrate it if possible; and, sheathing his sword, which would only have impeded his efforts in a struggle that required the full exertion of both his hands, -— with persevering toil, squeezing through the brambles on his hands and knees, and in some places obliged to force himself forward on his belly, —- he at length approached near enough to have a distinct view of an antique brazen lamp depending from the vaulted roof of an extensive cavern, which nature, aided by the art of man, had scooped out in the womb of the mountain: and, as he approached nearer, he perceived swords, spears, daggers, and other implements of death, hanging up against the sides of the rock.

At this sight, he paused for a moment: —- 'twas not the pause of fear; for, to fear, the heart of Manfredi was a stranger —- of Manfredi, who so oft had stemmed the tide of Battle, and, unappalled, opposed his single arm to the united efforts of a host of enemies: he felt for his sword, unknowing whether it had not been torn from his side in his struggle through the narrow difficult passage of the rock.

His sword was safe: he laid his hand to the hilt; and from the touch he instantly felt, as it were, an electric spark diffuse itself through his whole frame, and fire his soul with tenfold courage. At that moment, Manfredi would have singly faced a whole army. —- "Be they few, be they many," said he to himself -— "be they friends, be they foes -— Manfredi fears them not." —- So saying, he advanced to the mouth of the passage, which was at the height of several feet from the floor beneath, without steps, ladder, or any other help to descend.

Manfredi, though advanced in years, still possessed all the vigor and agility of youth; and hesitated not a moment to determine on the dangerous leap. But, though his courage was such as would not have shrunk from a myriad of armed foes, it was tempered with that vigilant prudence which never fails to seek and discover the most advantageous mode of attack or defence. And that circumspection, which, in the diversified scenes of war, he had so oft and so successfully employed for the safety of those who fought under his banners, now checked his ardor for a moment, till he should look around, and reconnoitre the place into which he was about to venture, alone, without even the protection of his buckler, which he had lost in his fall.

Besides the warlike implements he had before descried, he now saw on every side heaps of clothes of different kinds, the dresses of various nations -— piles of baggage and bales of merchandise of every description, vessels of wine, fruits, corn, the carcasses of a sheep and an ox, with fowl and game in abundance; and, at some distance, a table spread for supper, with large flagons of wine, and goblets of enormous size.

As well as he could distinguish at the distance, he judged, from the size of the table and the number of the plates and goblets, that the company was to consist of twelve. —- <Monologue>"'Tis well!" <M>said he</M>: "I now know the number of my enemies, if enemies they be: if friends, I shall not be one too many."</Monologue>

So saying, he was preparing to leap down, when, from an obscure corner of the cave which his eye had not before explored, a sigh reached his ear: -— it was a sigh of deep distress and agony; and it penetrated the heart of Manfredi: -— for Manfredi, though <Metaphor>stern as a lion in combat</Metaphor>, showed, in scenes of distress and woe, a heart of nature's finest mould, tempered by the soft hand of Pity herself. -— He looked forward towards the spot whence the sigh had issued; but at first could discern nothing. Another, a deeper sigh was heard, which seemed to rend the heart that heaved it. Tremblingly alive to the distress of the mourner, Manfredi strained his eyes to the utmost, and, screening them with his hand from the glare of the lamp, at length dimly discovered, in a dark recess, a female figure leaning on a low couch -— her cheek resting on one hand, while with the other she held a handkerchief to her eyes. Another sigh was now heard, and -— <DiaM>"Eternal God!" <M>said she, in a sweet but plaintive voice</M> -— "is it not enough that my Lorenzo has perished by the ruffian hand of the assassin, but I must myself be detained a prisoner, and..."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"By Heaven, fair lady, thou shalt not!" <M>exclaimed Manfredi, who at a bound was on the floor below</M>.</DiaM>

His voice, the noise of his fall, and the rattling of his armour, terrified the afflicted lady, who screamed aloud with affright, and made the hollow caverns ring with the shrill accents of her voice.

<DiaM>"Hey day!" <M>cried an old squallid beldam, hobbling in with a light in her hand</M>, -— "what ails madam now? -- some of your old freaks, I suppose. —- By the mass! you ought to think yourself happy, that...."</DiaM>

Here the gleam of her lamp flashing on Manfredi's armour, she started back in silence, and crossed herself again and again, uncertain whether she saw a human being or a ghost. -— Manfredi gave her no time to recover from her surprise; but, seising her by the hair, <DiaM>"Say, wretch," <M>cried he</M>, "what means all this? -— nay, speak thyself, fair lady; who keeps thee here, and why?"</DiaM> —- <DiaM>"Alas! signor," <M>said she</M>, "there is now no time for explanations. If thou be a friend and canst open yon iron door for my escape, there is not a moment to lose: —- they will soon be here: —- ere now they were expected: —- and, if they return and find thee in this cave -— however great thy strength and courage, their numbers will overpower thee."</DiaM>

Manfredi felt no apprehensions for his own safety; but, unwilling to expose the lady by delay -— <DiaM>"Open," <M>said he to the terrified old hag</M> -— "open quick that door; and, at thy peril...."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Alas! signor," <M>replied she</M>, "I have not the key: they always carry it with them, after locking the door on the outside."</DiaM>

Enraged, Manfredi sprang to the iron door, and strove to force it open: but, though possessed of Herculean strength, it baffled his utmost efforts.</SceneAction>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. II.</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia><Dia>"AN unlucky rencounter indeed, brother Ambrose! -— But the devil will sometimes leave us friars in the lurch, as well as other folk; and we cannot always hope to escape. —- Some years ago, I myself....But I interrupt your story: —- pray proceed: I long to learn the issue."</Dia>

<DiaInset1P>"Though my shoulders," <M>resumed Ambrose</M>, "full sorely aked -— and they still ake to this hour -— from the vigorous application of the cudgel with which her brother had belabored me; yet I was consoled by the hope that he had not recognised my person; in which case, I should have been quit for the drubbing, as I was certain that Annetta herself, whose affection and fidelity I could depend on, would not betray me; and, if the matter came to be blazed abroad, we of our convent would have easily found means to shift the scandal, from our own body, to a community of Franciscan friars that lived in the neighbourhood, several of whom were strongly suspected of similar intrigues."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"The very mode," <M>interrupted Serafino</M>, "that I pursued in my affair -— and so successfully, as to have the whole business fathered not only on a convent of a different order, but even on a particular friar of that convent, who was a personal enemy of mine."</DiaInsetInterruptionDia>

<DiaInset1P>"Uncertain," <M>continued Ambrose</M>, "whether my hopes were well founded, I thought it best to lurk awhile about the house, and, like a prudent general, under cover of the darkness to reconnoitre the motions of the enemy, and gain further intelligence. Accordingly I stole softly back to the door, and could now plainly hear her brother relate the discovery to his father, who was by this time up and dressed. —- He named me, and swore to the identity of my person."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"Ha!" <M>exclaimed Serafino</M>, "there you were less fortunate than I."</DiaInsetInterruptionDia>

<DiaInset1P>"The father," <M>added Ambrose</M>, "was exasperated —- the brother was enraged. —- The latter proposed to run directly to the convent, call up the prior, and make his complaint -— or to lay the whole matter before a magistrate next morning. —- But the father, though his rage was equal to that of his son, dissuaded him from both; and told him, that, by such steps, he would, instead of obtaining redress, only ruin himself and the whole family, and get them all thrown into the inquisition, as heretics, and enemies to holy mother church."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"Ha! ha! ha!" <M>interrupted again Serafino</M> -— "'tis well the rogues thought of that. —- Were it not for that same inquisition, not a friar of us could live now-a-days. —- Well, thanks to that glorious invention, they determined, I suppose, to pass the matter over in silence."</DiaInsetInterruptionDia>

<DiaInset1P>"The son," <M>resumed Ambrose</M>, "being with difficulty deterred from making a noise on the occasion, resolved nevertheless to avenge the honor of the family, and dispatch me by private assassination;" —- 'And I don't know,' —- added he, running furiously to a drawer, and snatching a dagger out of it —- (for, through a crevice in the door, I could plainly perceive all his motions) —- 'I don't know but I can yet overtake the villain ere he reach his convent, and sacrifice him to my vengeance this very night.'"</DiaInset1P>

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"By the mass," <M>said Serafino</M>, "he seemed determined to make short work of it! -— But Annetta —- you did not hear, I suppose, what they intended to do with her?"</DiaInsetInterruptionDia>

<DiaInset1P>"I hope," <M>replied Ambrose</M>, "that, in such a situation as mine was, you would not have me trouble my head about the fate of a silly girl. -— By this time, probably, she has been turned out of doors, or strangled, or -— God knows what. —- But," <M>added he, shrugging up his shoulders with the most perfect apathy</M>, -— "such things will happen."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"True," <M>returned Serafino with equal <i>sang-froid:</i></M> "in spite of all our precautions, misfortunes will sometimes occur; and, when they do, why then, as the old saying is, what cannot be cured must be endured: so we'll think no more of Annetta, but return to the young bravo with his dagger."</DiaInsetInterruptionDia>

<DiaInset1P>"When I saw him," <M>resumed Ambrose</M>, "thus armed and thus determined, I thought not a moment was to be lost in providing for my safety: and, without waiting to see or hear any more, -— for by this time, as you may judge, I had already heard and seen quite enough...."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"Aye," <M>replied Serafino</M>, "sufficient, I warrant you, to alarm the stoutest friar of us all. —- Well! you ran for it, I suppose."</DiaInsetInterruptionDia>

<DiaInset1P>"I immediately took to my heels, and ran, with might and main, as fast as my legs could carry me. And indeed well it was that I did so: for, before I had proceeded a hundred yards, I heard the door opened and violently dashed back again, and could soon hear Pedro's footsteps pursuing me. -— The sound, you may guess, added wings to my speed; but my fear had so far got the better of my reason and judgement, that, instead of turning aside into the woods and eluding his pursuit, I continued to run straight forward in the direct road to the convent —- the very road which he intended to pursue. Nor did I advert to my folly in this instance, till, striking my foot against a stone, I fell headlong to the ground."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"Mercy on us!" <M>exclaimed Serafino</M> -— "my blood runs cold at the very idea! —- sure nothing short of a miracle could now rescue you from Pedro's dagger."</DiaInsetInterruptionDia>

<DiaInset1P>"In the fall, I received this bruise that you see on my temple, but otherwise escaped unhurt: and, as good luck would have it, in raising myself from the ground, I found under my hand a broken branch of a tree, short, stout, and heavy, —- an excellent weapon in case of a rencounter. —- I instinctively seised it; and, as the footsteps of Pedro, whom before my fall I was gradually leaving at a greater and a greater distance behind, were now heard fast approaching -— a sudden thought occurred to me. -— Though it was still dark, yet the darkness was so far diminished that I could faintly distinguish the trees at a small distance around me: and, as I was afraid, that, although I should turn from the direct road, and take a different route, Pedro, who was now so near, would hear my steps, and pursue in the same direction, I concealed myself behind the trunk of a large tree in a narrow part of the road, where I knew my pursuer must pass within a yard of me, and where I could not fail to have a glimpse of him as he passed. There, with my cudgel uplifted in the most advantageous attitude for striking a home blow, I waited his approach."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"I admire your presence of mind," <M>said Serafino</M>; "and I already anticipate the event."</DiaInsetInterruptionDia>

<DiaInset1P>"I waited not many seconds in that posture, till Pedro approached the spot; and, though my heart now quaked within me, and my teeth chattered in my head, I nevertheless made one desperate effort; and, summoning all my strength, just as he was passing, struck him such a blow on the crown, as felled him instantly to the earth."</DiaInset1P>

<DiaInsetInterruptionDia>"Bravo!" <M>exclaimed Serafino</M>; —- "and there let the rogue lie a while kicking up his heels, until we replenish our glasses; for I always like to moisten a good story. -— Our wine, you see, is not bad; and, though I say it, who should not say it, there is not a nobleman within ten leagues of us, that uncorks a flask of better liquor than we drink in this convent. -— And then, as to quantity, thanks to the devout liberality of the pious fools around us, we have more than we know what to do with; insomuch that we must have our cellars considerably enlarged before the next vintage."</DiaInsetInterruptionDia>

So saying, he had filled brother Ambrose's capacious goblet and his own, brim-full of the richest juice of the grape, which being jovially tossed off to the health of "Jolly Friars all" ----

<DiaInset1P>"I staid not," <M>continued Ambrose</M>, "to repeat my blow, or to examine whether I had finished him: but, as he said not a word, and hardly uttered a groan, I conclude that I at once gave him his <i>quietus</i>. —- Be that, however, as it may, I hasted with speed to the convent, and related every circumstance to the prior, who chid me severely for my want of caution on the occasion; and read me a serious lecture on the necessity of circumspection in a friar, lest any of his pranks should get wind, and bring a discredit on the order. However, as it was now too late to recall the past, he thought it best for me to avoid the resentment of Pedro, if alive -— and, if dead, that of his father -— by retiring to a distant convent beyond their reach. —- Accordingly he signed and sealed me a passport on the spot, and directed me to your community, where I safely arrived on Sunday last, as you know, after a long and fatiguing journey, —- traveling only by night, in order to avoid being traced, and resting by day in different convents on the road."</DiaInset1P>

Here Serafino again replenished the glasses, which were scarcely emptied to a bacchanalian toast, when -— the clock striking twelve -— <DiaM>"We must now," <M>said he</M>, "part for a while, unless you choose to accompany me to the choir -— it being my turn to-night to ring the bell and sing matins."</DiaM>

Ambrose testifying his readiness to accompany him -— <DiaM>"Hold!" <M>said Serafino</M> —- "psalm-singing is dry work: -— take the glasses with you: I'll draw a fresh cork; and, in the intervals of chaunting, we can still moisten the clay."</DiaM>

So saying, he uncorked a large flask; and, grasping it in one hand, and a candle in the other, <Blend>he proceeded to the choir</Blend>, while Ambrose, with a glass in each hand, followed close behind.

Arrived in the sacristy, Serafino, laying down his flask and his candle, unlocked the door of a private recess, and took out two instruments, which, by the novelty of their appearance, immediately fixed the attention of Ambrose. -— He viewed them for a while with surprise; and, unable to divine their use, <DiaM>"Tell me, good brother," <M>said he</M>, "what mean those instruments? -— some wise invention, I ween, though I cannot penetrate the design."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Follow me to the choir," <M>replied Serafino</M>: —- "I'll at once explain to you the utility of this happy invention, and teach you how to use it: —- for, though we have hitherto spared you, as being a stranger, and just come off a long journey, it will soon be your turn to perform a compound-solo on these instruments."</DiaM>

Brother Ambrose, now more and more astonished, and eager to learn the meaning of what he saw and heard, <Blend>followed him to the choir</Blend>, where, while Serafino was ringing the matin bell, he took up one of the instruments, and curiously examined it.

It was a kind of speaking-trumpet, which, from a single mouth-piece, branched out into a number of tubes -— some longer, some shorter -— some twisted round like a worm, some straight -— some wide at the extremity, others narrow -— some rough and uneven on the inside, others smooth and polished. —- The other instrument was constructed in the same fashion, only with some little variation in the length, diameter, and curvature of the tubes.

<DiaM>"I now conceive," <M>said he to Serafino, who by this time had done ringing the bell</M> -- "I conceive that these are a kind of musical instruments which you use in the service: -— but when do you mean to begin? I don't see any of the fathers coming -— nor yet any of the lay-brethren."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Here," <M>said Serafino, taking the instruments, one in each hand</M> —- "here I have in my hands all the fathers and lay-brothers of our whole convent; and you shall soon hear them all sing in full chorus."</DiaM>

So saying, he applied one of the instruments to his mouth, and, with Stentorean voice, chaunted through it the first verse of a psalm -— when the sound, issuing through the different tubes, and imitating so many different voices, made the vaulted dome re-echo with loud psalmody. -— Then using in like manner the other instrument, be chaunted the second verse in as many different tones: and, thus alternately sounding the trumpet in his right hand, and that in his left, he went through the whole psalm, which, to a person without the walls of the church, would have appeared to be sung by a full choir.

At the first sound of the instrument, Ambrose had raised his hands and eyes to heaven in silent astonishment; and, in that posture, continued motionless as a statue, till, the holy trumpeter being come to one of those pauses in the service, where the prayers are supposed to be recited in a low voice -— <DiaM>"I swear," <M>said he</M>, "by the tonsure of our holy founder, this is one of the most glorious inventions I ever heard of. The author of it deserves to be canonised as a saint, for rendering such a service to the order. I suppose it must be a new invention; for, in no one of the many convents I have visited, did I ever before see or hear of such instruments."</DiaM>

<DiaInset1P>"Our present prior," <M>replied Serafino</M>, "has the honor of the invention: and the occasion was simply this. —- In our convent, as in most others, it was the custom to sing matins only occasionally, and by way of recreation; though we were always careful to have the bell rung regularly at midnight, to impress the good folk of the adjacent villages, and casual travelers passing this way, with a belief that service was performed every night. —- Thus matters had gone quietly on from time immemorial, till, one unlucky night about three months ago, a neighbouring shepherd, happening to pass this way just at the matin hour, took shelter from a storm in the porch of our church, and observed, that, though the bell had been rung, there was no service.

"Next morning, he mentioned this discovery: but luckily it was to a friend of our convent, who immediately gave us intelligence of it. —- To stop the fellow's mouth, we contrived to have him kidnapped in less than four and twenty hours; and he is now confined in one of the dungeons of this convent, twenty feet under ground; where we feed the rogue with bread and water; and whence he shall never more come forth to see the light of God's sun -— not even if the convent were on fire over his head.

"To prevent similar accidents in future, our prior (who was formerly captain of a Barbary corsair, and well acquainted with the use of the speaking-trumpet) contrived these instruments, which one of the lay-brothers, in turn, thus uses every night. Some other of our communities have already adopted the invention: and, from its evident utility, I doubt not, that, in the course of a year or two, every convent of the order will be furnished with similar instruments."</DiaInset1P>

Here Serafino, after a glass to the health of the ingenious prior, resumed his trumpet-psalmody; and, having gone through the whole service, and, in the intervals of singing, emptied the flask with his new acquaintance, —- was preparing to retire to his cell, when he heard the sound of a private bell which usually announced a visit from the banditti. -- He immediately ran to open the gates for their admission -— having previously pulled another bell that hung in the prior's room, to give him notice of their arrival.</SceneDia>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. III.</ChapMarker>

<SceneAction><Graft>SERAFINO</Graft> had hardly opened the outward gate for the admission of the banditti, when, at the inner door, appeared, yawning and rubbing his eyes, father Apostolico the prior, who looking down the cloister as the company advanced towards him, —- <DiaM>"Welcome, my friends!" <M>said he</M>: "what cheer to-night?" -— <M>and, observing four of the number who carried a heavy burden</M>, -— "Hah! I see you have had good success: —- you come loaded with spoil. I hope, however, that you made sure work with the parties concerned, and suffered no informers to escape."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nay, reverend father," <M>replied Sangnigno, the lieutenant of the band, who now led the van</M>, —- "though men be valiant, they cannot always be successful. This unlucky night we have got nothing but hard blows: witness our gallant captain there, carried on the shoulders of four of our brave comrades, and, I fear, completely disabled from ever again following the honorable profession of arms. He is so dangerously wounded, that we could not venture to carry him back to the garrison in his present condition; but were obliged to fetch him hither to have his wounds dressed."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Not a moment shall be lost," <M>answered the prior</M>. -— "Take him up quick to the infirmary; you know the way. And you," <M>added he, turning to Serafino</M>, "run, and instantly call up father Innocent and the infirmarian, to give the captain medical assistance: then haste to my closet, and fetch a bottle of liqueur, that I may give him a cordial to revive his spirits."</DiaM>

Serafino, in obedience to the prior's commands, instantly flew to execute his commission; when, as the party advanced in slow procession along the cloister, <DiaM>"I hope," <M>whispered father Fidele, who by this time had joined the prior</M>, —- "I hope the rogues are not cheating us of our share of the booty, as they have already done once or twice before."</DiaM> —- <DiaM>"Hush!" <M>said the prior</M>,  -— "we'll talk of that anon. -— You see what a condition the captain is reduced to: he will certainly have recourse to confession and absolution before he dies: I shall then learn the true state of the case; and we will afterwards act accordingly."</DiaM>

Arrived in the infirmary, the four robbers, who supported their wounded chief, gently laid him down upon a couch, pale, speechless, and wholly bereft of motion. —- Father Innocent and the infirmarian soon made their appearance, followed by Serafino with a flask of the prior's choicest liqueur: and, while the compassionate prior poured a cordial down the patient's throat, Innocent examined and wiped his wounds, and the infirmarian, by his direction, was busily employed in preparing salves and bandages.

Refreshed by the cordial, the captain after a while exhibited signs of returning life. He opened his eyes, surveyed the preparations that were making to relieve him; and, summoning up sufficient strength to speak, <DiaM>"Alas!" <M>said he to the prior in feeble tone</M> -— "alas, good father, I feel my end approaching: your assistance comes too late. The hand of death is upon me: cold and heavy I feel it here," <M>added he, endeavouring to lay his hand on his heart</M>: "I have not an hour to live. But ah! what will become of my poor sinful soul? —- so many robberies! —- so many murders! —- oh! oh! oh!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Be of good cheer, my son," <M>replied the prior</M>: "though your sins were ten times as many in number, and every one ten times as great as all those of your whole life taken together, our sacred institution offers you a sure resource. Know you not, that the founder of our holy order obtained as a special favor from the Blessed Virgin, that whoever should die in our habit, should be safe from all the powers of hell? Clad in that sacred robe, as in celestial armour, you will have nought to fear from the devil or his infernal host."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Quick then," <M>said the captain</M> -— "quick, for Heaven's sake, let me be arrayed in that saving dress, while my poor unfortunate soul is one step on this side the brink of hell, and there yet remains any hope of salvation."</DiaM>

Serafino, admonished by a nod from the prior, instantly ran to fetch the habit, which being produced, and put on the captain with the usual formality of prayers and benedictions, he soon felt the anguish of his soul considerably alleviated, and now began to banish the thoughts of hell. -— <Dia>"But, purgatory! good father! -— ah! the flames of purgatory!"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Aye," <M>said the prior</M>: "purgatory, to be sure, still remains: and even the holy fathers of our order do not always escape its torments. —- But be comforted, my son: charity covereth a multitude of sins: and the charitable donations you have made to our convent, together with the masses and prayers we have already offered up for you, will certainly take off at least a thousand or two of years from the term of your punishment; though -— God be merciful to all sinners! —- perhaps ten thousand years more remain to be spent in raging flames, and seas of boiling, blazing, scalding brimstone."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ah! ah! ah!" <M>exclaimed the captain, terrified at the dreadful idea of the reception he expected to find in the other world</M>: —- "ah! what would I not give to shorten the period of my sufferings!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Little or much," <M>replied the prior</M>, "'tis equally acceptable to God and our holy mother the church. -— Remember the widow's mite, and be comforted: you cannot bestow more than you possess: but, whatever it be, our convent will gratefully accept it, and offer up a daily requiem for your soul: —- and this last act of charity, together with our pious and fervent prayers, will be so efficacious, that your torments will be alleviated while you remain in purgatory, and you shall not be detained longer than forty days in that place of punishment; after which, you will ascend directly to heaven, and there occupy, to all eternity, a glorious place among the saints of our order, in whose sacred habit you die."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have in my iron chest," <M>added the captain</M>, "fifteen hundred pieces of gold: these I bequeath to the convent."</DiaM> -— <DiaM>"Mind," <M>said father Fidele in a low voice to the lieutenant</M> —- "fifteen hundred, he said."</DiaM> —- <DiaM>"Aye," <M>replied the lieutenant</M>, "fifteen hundred: I know he has them; and many a hard-fought battle they cost him: but you shall receive them every one. I am a man of honor, and so is every man of our troop; and we would scorn to take an unfair advantage."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And my horse," <M>continued the captain</M> —- "I bequeath him to the order, together with the contents of my seven large chests, and my share of the corn and wine at the garrison."</DiaM> -— Here again Fidele turned to the lieutenant, noticing every article of the bequest. <DiaM>"I shall remember them," <M>said the latter</M>: "you need not fear; we will give the convent a good account of them: —- as for the horse, he is now in the courtyard below: and you may at once order him to the stable of the convent, or, if it is agreeable to the reverend fathers, I will purchase him for two hundred crowns."</DiaM> —- <DiaM>"We will talk of that another time," <M>replied Fidele</M>: "meanwhile let us withdraw; I see the captain is preparing for confession and absolution before his departure."</DiaM>

Hereupon Fidele led the way, and, followed by Innocent, Serafino, the lieutenant, and his banditti, proceeded to the refectory, where wine, cold meat, and other refreshments, were quickly placed before the robbers, while the prior was employed in hearing the confession of the dying captain, administering to him ghostly consolation, and, above all, carefully inquiring whether he had any thing further to bequeath to the convent. Having fully satisfied himself on this last head, and lulled the conscience of the dying sinner to sleep with solemn and repeated assurances of the favor of Heaven, he finally gave him a plenary absolution and remission of all his sins; after which, the captain, full of hope and confidence, took his departure for the other world, where, no doubt, he soon learned from experience whether the habit of St. Dominic possessed all that wonderous efficacy attributed to it by the prior.

The captain having breathed his last, the prior repaired to the hall where the banditti were refreshing themselves; and having announced the death of their late commander, —- <DiaM>"Ah!" <M>said the lieutenant</M>, "'tis what we must all come to, sooner or later: and, though I regret our gallant chief, I cannot but say I am better pleased he should be snatched from us in this way, than die, as our former captain did, a lingering death under the hands of the executioner. -- But 'tis vain to dwell on our misfortunes: —- come, my brave fellows, fill your glasses, and here's to our better success the next time!"</DiaM>

The prior now proceeded to make his arrangements with the lieutenant, for the safe conveyance to the convent of the various articles bequeathed by the deceased -— accepted the price offered for his horse — promised to have masses and requiems without number sung for the repose of his soul; and finally inquired into the particulars of their late disastrous rencounter.

<DiaM>"About a mile from this convent," <M>said the lieutenant</M>, "we fell in with two men on horseback. -- What they were, we could not at first distinguish in the dark: but they soon showed us they were not poltroons: for no sooner did our captain call to them to halt, than they charged us sword in hand. And, when we came to dry blows, it appeared they were armed cap-a-pie: and, as I am a living man, and hope to escape the gallows, I am convinced they were dressed in enchanted armour, which no sword could penetrate. But to return to my story, one of them, whom his companion called by the name of Manfredi...."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ha! Manfredi!" <M>exclaimed the prior, turning pale at the sound</M> -— "Manfredi, did you say?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"So his fellow-traveler called him," <M>replied the lieutenant, who did not take notice of the prior's perturbation, though sufficiently visible to his brother monks, who, from the secret workings of conscience, all equally participated his alarm.</M></DiaM>

The prior then, endeavouring to resume his composure, inquired of the lieutenant, if, in the confusion of the rencounter, he could form any judgement of that Manfredi -— whether he were an old or a young man, tall or otherwise?

<DiaInset1P>"All that I know of him," <M>answered the lieutenant</M>, "is, that he deals very hard blows, and, I believe, wears enchanted armour, as I said before. As a proof of the former, with one blow that he leveled at my head, he almost struck me from the saddle; and, had I not fortunately been armed with so strong and firm a head-piece, I make no doubt that he would have cleft me to the chine, and made me a partner with our captain in your masses and requiems. And, as to his armour, though I wear as well-tempered a sword as any man within a hundred miles of me, and know how to handle it as well as most men —- I struck him ten or a dozen blows with all my might, but with as little effect as if I had been whipping an anvil with an osier twig. At length, seeing our captain and one of our comrades laid low, and that our swords and battle-axes could make no impression on those knights, or magicians, or whatever else they were, I gave the signal for retreat. They pursued us for a little way; but, afraid, as I suppose, to entangle themselves in the intricacies of the forest, they soon desisted from the pursuit, and continued their journey. As soon as we found that the coast was clear, we returned to the field of battle, where we found our captain groaning, and faint with loss of blood, and the other poor fellow stone-dead. The latter we concealed in a thicket, till we have a little more leisure to bury him; and, brought the captain hither. His horse, being accustomed to troop with ours, still followed us in all our motions, and is safe below in the court-yard, as you already know."</DiaInset1P>

The lieutenant, having concluded his recital, rose with his companions, and took his leave of the monks, after having recommended to them the care of burying the deceased captain, and praying him out of purgatory according to promise.

After the departure of the banditti, the first care of the fathers was to inter the remains of their good friend and benefactor, the captain. This office they performed in haste, lest they should be overtaken by the morning light, which was now fast approaching. But, dearly as the deceased had purchased their prayers, —- <DiaM>"Is it understood," <M>said father Fidele, while Serafino was digging the grave</M> -— "is it understood, father Apostolico, that we are to sing a requiem for this fellow's soul?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"A requiem!" <M>returned the prior, with an air and tone of the most sovereign contempt</M> -— "a requiem indeed! -— Why, father Fidele, you talk like one of the foolish ignorant vulgar who believe in the efficacy of our prayers: I thought you were too well informed to think our masses or psalm-singing can aught avail the souls of the dead."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nay," <M>replied Fidele</M>, "I am convinced of their inefficacy as well as you: but, as the captain has so very handsomely purchased our prayers, I did not know but you might be inclined to let him e'en have a few, were it only to satisfy his surviving brethren of the blade."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Pshaw!" <M>answered the prior</M> —- "such punctilios may be very well with respect to honest folk who pay us openly in the face of day, and whose friends and relatives will come and attend at the service. But the robbers, you see, are already gone: they have hardly stopped to listen without the doors, and find out whether we sing requiems or not: and you know they will never set foot within our church, unless to take shelter from the officers of justice. —- Besides, we have something more serious to think of, than either the captain or his requiem. —- That Manfredi, whom the lieutenant mentioned! —- my mind misgives me sadly on the occasion. Should he prove the same, what a sad reverse for us! And I can scarce help thinking that he is: —- his strength, his courage, every thing corresponds. -— At all events, as soon as the sun rises, I will go in person to communicate my suspicions to Manfredi's brother, and consult with him what is to be done, in case my fears be realised."</DiaM>

Scarcely had the prior uttered these words, when the bell at the outer gate was long and loudly rung, as by a person in imminent danger or alarm. Knowing from the sound of the bell that it was not the banditti who were returned, the fathers were at a loss to conceive from whom, or on what occasion, they were to receive a visit at so unseasonable an hour. They sent, however, to admit the visitor: when lo! Manfredi's brother appeared, with a pale and haggard countenance: and the first word he uttered was the name of Manfredi!</SceneAction>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. IV.</ChapMarker>

<SceneAction>RUDOLPHO still continued galloping furiously onwards at a hazard, through brakes and thickets. By reason of the swift motion of his steed, and the extreme darkness which prevailed around him, he had not yet missed his friend Manfredi, of whose disaster he was totally ignorant, but thought him following at a distance, especially as he heard the sound, though a distant one, of his courser's feet.

Rudolpho was making impetuously towards the quarter whence the screams had reached his ears; when he fancied that they sounded faint, as if they were smothered, and then suddenly heard them again as distinctly as before; soon after which, they entirely ceased. -— Every thing was now immersed in the gloomy silence of the midnight hour: —- nought was to be heard, save the wind that gently sighed in faint murmurs among the thick foliage of the surrounding trees. All being enveloped in total darkness, Rudolpho remained uncertain what course to pursue. For a moment he stopped his courser's speed, to catch again the sound, whereby to direct his bewildered steps in the intricate mazes of the forest. He listened, and thought he could distinguish the sound of men's voices, as if in angry parley: in an instant after, it was succeeded by a clashing of swords. Fired at the sound, his martial spirit caught the alarm, and animated the noble heart that within his bosom swelled and panted with impatient ardor to join in the combat. <MonologueThought>"Belike," <M>thought he</M>, "it is a band of robbers attacking some benighted travelers, who, having lost their way in these pathless woods, have fallen into the hands of those merciless villains, who intend to rob, and, perchance -— enraged by their attempting to defend themselves —- may afterwards murder them."</MonologueThought>

Rudolpho's generous bosom glowed with indignation at the idea -— <Monologue>"Barbarous villains!" <M>he exclaimed, instinctively un-sheathing his sword</M>; "by heavens, I will, at the hazard of my life, protect those against whom you aim your murderous daggers!"</Monologue>

At these words, he immediately directed his horse's steps toward the place whence the sound proceeded; and, spurring him on, quickly regained his former swiftness. Impetuously he darted forward on full gallop, with a resolute determination of braving every danger in assisting the distressed objects, whom his thoughts represented as surrounded by a ferocious band of midnight assassins, in vain endeavouring to repulse their overpowering attacks; or sinking perhaps beneath the murderous weapons of the banditti that infested this forest, who lurked all the day among the rocks, in the deep caverns and hollow glens of these gloomy woods, till night encouraged them to sally forth under cover of its darkness, and securely to plunder such weary and way-worn travelers as chance threw in their way.

Rudolpho observed; as he advanced, a faint light that gleamed between the trees, and proceeding from the same place as the sound, by which he was enabled with the greater certainty to direct his course. —- As he approached nearer, he perceived, by the pale glimmering of some torches that lay half-extinguished on the ground, a lady wrapt in a large mantle; her mouth stopped with a handkerchief bound over it, so as to prevent her outcries, from being heard. She was in vain striving to extricate herself from the arms of a man, whose costly dress proclaimed him of high and noble rank. He, assisted by three others, who appeared to be his servants, had just succeeded in their endeavours to place the lady, in despite of all her struggles, on horseback. —- Further on, at a small distance from them, were two men on horseback, desperately defending themselves against the furious attacks of four others who surrounded them, and who were likewise mounted.

Rudolpho, regardless of his own danger, without a moment's hesitation, sword in hand uplifted, ready to cleave those down that would oppose his passage, rushed forward, determined to afford distressed innocence that assistance against ruffian guilt which it stood most in need of. He advanced, with all the speed his courser could make, toward the men who had forced the lady on horseback; and, as he rode, he loudly called out to them to desist.

His sudden and formidable appearance startled their master, who immediately leaped up behind the lady on the horse, and, seising her in his arms, clapped spurs to his courser's sides, and rode, on a full gallop, towards an opening in the woods. But, unfortunately for him, ere he could reach it, his horse stumbled, throwing both him and the lady. Manfredi's brother (for it was no other than he) lay for a minute on the ground, stunned by the violence of the fall. The lady, fortunately, suffered little or no hurt, except the terror it had occasioned her; but, seising the opportunity to make her escape from him, though much weakened by her former unavailing efforts, she exerted all her remaining strength; and, slipping the handkerchief from before her mouth, hastily ran toward Rudolpho. The men had mounted their horses, in order to follow their master: but, on seeing him fall, they immediately dismounted, and hastened to raise him from the ground. He soon recovered his recollection.

It is impossible to describe the mingled rage and disappointment which possessed his breast, when, casting his eyes anxiously around, he perceived the flight of the lady. —- In a furious state, he instantly pursued her, having first commanded his servants to attack Rudolpho, whose resolute demeanour had struck a terror into the dastardly and revengeful soul of Tancred (for that was his name), who thought, that, in the confusion of the combat, while Rudolpho was employed in defending himself against the swords of his servants, he should be able to recover and ride off with the lady, who had by this time got to some distance; when, overpowered by terror, and exhausted with the exertions she had before made to release herself, her strength failed her, and she sunk to the ground within a few paces of Rudolpho; who, the instant that his eye caught sight of her, leaped from the back of his horse, and raised her in his arms from the earth.

The tone of voice in which she besought him to protect her, touched with pity and compassion the heart of Rudolpho, who thought he knew the wonderful melody of her voice. —- <Exclamation>But what was his amazement, when suddenly she uttered an exclamation of great surprise, and immediately swooned in his arms!</Exclamation> This drew his attention. He looked; and, by the light which the torches gave, he recognised the features of her whom he loved -— the daughter of his friend Manfredi.

<DiaM>"Gracious Heavens!" <M>he exclaimed, with a voice partaking of his transport and astonishment</M> —- "is it possible? -— I can scarcely believe my eyes! -— It is her face! -— her form! -— It is my Juliet! -— The joy of our meeting thus unexpectedly has overcome her. —- Revive, my love! —- my Juliet, revive! —- Look up, and bless me with thine eyes! —- It is thy Rudolpho calls on thee.... Soft! she moves......Fear not, my Juliet!" <M>added he, when she was recovered from her swoon</M>: —- "fear not! —- They shall not harm thee. Thy father, the noble Manfredi, count D'Alvazzi, has escaped from shipwreck and slavery. —- Ere now I expected him to appear, as I am certain that he can not be far off."</DiaM>

Hardly had he spoken these words, when he found himself assaulted furiously by the servants of Tancred. Their master was close by them, waiting for a favorable opportunity to execute his design. He heard the words of Rudolpho, and from them sufficiently understood that Manfredi was close at hand. He started, and retired back some paces, every nerve trembling with apprehension and surprise. His heart beat with quick and violent palpitations: his knees began to totter beneath the weight of his body: his thoughts teemed with gloomy presages of approaching destruction: his conscience rose up in judgement against him; and he underwent a severe paroxysm of dismay and distraction. He felt as it were a blow upon his heart, giving him to feel the torments of hell while upon earth. His spirits were agitated into a state of fermentation that produced a species of resolution similar to that which is inspired by wine; and, by an impulse that seemed almost supernatural, he was immediately hurried into measures for his own preservation. Every moment he expected to behold Manfredi; and he well knew that his servants, who began already to retreat before Rudolpho, would be utterly unable to protect him from the sword of Manfredi, whose amazing strength, together with his persevering, cool, and determined courage, shook the trembling soul of Tancred with deadly dismay. Prompted, therefore, by his fears, and unwilling to hazard his life by longer delay, he resolved to flee; more especially as he saw that there was not the least probability of succeeding in his design. Accordingly, he threw himself upon one of the horses that was grazing quietly near him. So much had his terror and surprise deprived him of his powers, that he scarcely could muster strength enough to sit with any degree of firmness in the saddle. A paleness, like the livid hue of death, sat on his countenance. He still shook with fear; yet he derived some faint glimmerings of hope from the thought of having it in his power to avoid by flight what his conscience whispered him he justly deserved to meet -— the speedy vengeance of the injured Manfredi.

This gleam of hope, feeble as it was, yet dispersed, in some measure, a part of his former terrors; notwithstanding it was attended by a fear lest he should be pursued and overtaken, unless he should be fortunate enough to escape by riding into the thickest of the forest; which course he directly determined to pursue. Harassed with his apprehensions, he clapped spurs to his courser's sides, instantly as he felt himself in the saddle, and rode at full speed among the trees, resolved to gallop forward until he should be disengaged from the woods.</SceneAction>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. V.</ChapMarker>

<SceneAction>MEANWHILE Rudolpho was furiously engaged with Tancred's servants. They soon found, to their cost, that the invincible courage and perseverance of their opponent was not so easy to overcome as they had at first imagined. They were sufficiently convinced of his strength and skill, by the heavy strokes that he dealt among them with unsparing hand. The sword, brandished by his active and vigorous arm, inflicted a fresh wound with almost every blow; while theirs made not the least impression on him.

At length, after a short but furious combat, they were compelled by the superior valour of Rudolpho, to give way; fighting, as they slowly retreated toward the spot where their companions were combating, with the two men; the latter still maintaining, with great resolution and spirit, an obstinate resistance against the repeated assaults of their adversaries, who were now joined by their comrades that retreated before the irresistible arm of Rudolpho.

United, and deriving fresh vigor from their superiority of numbers, they encouraged each his fellow, and, sword in hand, they furiously charged the two men, who still continued their obstinate resistance. But Rudolpho soon ranged himself on the side of the latter, and joined in the combat. Rapid and violent as is the beating tempest, the strokes of his massive sword fell on the heads of those whose weapons aimed at the life of the two men; who, animated by the example which he set, courageously seconded his efforts, and with such success that their opponents were quickly constrained to quit the field, and seek their safety in immediate flight. They soon disappeared among the trees; following, as best they could, the same route their master had taken; abandoning the bodies of their companions, pierced and bleeding with the many wounds which they had received.

Immediately as Tancred's servants had attacked Rudolpho, the lady Juliet retired; and, for her better security, concealed herself behind some spreading trees that grew in wild and native luxuriancy near the spot. There she could with safety wait the event of the combat: -— but she trembled as she beheld the danger to which the impetuous valour of Rudolpho exposed his life —- of that Rudolpho who, by some amazing interposition of Providence, was restored to her alive, after she had so long lamented him as dead; —- arrived too at the very moment when most she needed his protection. -— The terror and apprehensions she had felt, during the combat, for the safety of him whom she loved with a passion the most pure and delicate, were converted into emotions of admiration and joy, when she perceived her ravishers compelled to flee precipitately. So soon as they were out of sight, she quitted her retreat, and advanced directly toward her valiant deliverers, to whom she returned her thanks with many expressions of gratitude for her rescue.

Rudolpho, with a vehemence that convinced Juliet his love for her was not in the least abated by their long separation, received and returned the caresses which the excess of her tenderness and joy bestowed on him, whose faithful love had been long tried, and merited all the proofs in her power to give of its being returned with equal constancy and ardor. Hitherto her memory had been wholly suspended by violent passions, which had crowded upon her mind in rapid and uninterrupted succession; but now that they were in some degree subsided, and her recollection returned, she suddenly remembered the words of Rudolpho.

<DiaM>"Where is my father?" <M>she exclaimed</M>. "Did you not tell me that he was at hand?"</DiaM>

At these words Rudolpho cast his eyes around, and instantly missed his friend Manfredi. Surprised and alarmed, his first impulse was immediately to go in search of him; but the thought of leaving his beloved Juliet, and in the power of men who were, he plainly saw, utterly unknown to her, with-held him from following it: -— he, therefore, after a moment's consideration, formed a determination to continue with her until she were lodged in some place of security. Thus resolved, he answered the repeated and anxious inquiries of Juliet after her father: he offered many and various conjectures on the occasion of his absence, none of which approached in the least toward the truth of the matter; the disaster which had in reality befallen Manfredi never once occurring to his imagination, though it represented others far more gloomy and dreadful.

<DiaM>"I am determined," <M>said he</M>, "at all events, when the morning light has dawned from the east, I'll forth in search of him; but first I'll convey thee from the forest: and haply our good fortune may conduct us to some lowly cot, where at least you will rest with safety, while I proceed to execute my determination."</DiaM>

Though both the strangers had received several wounds in the encounter, yet they were but slight ones, and not dangerous enough to disable them from sitting their horses; in the best manner they were able, they bound them up, to prevent the blood from flowing; which being accomplished, one of the two strangers, who appeared the master of the other, addressed himself to Rudolpho -—

<DiaM>"Signor," <M>said he</M>, "as the night is far advanced, and these almost uninhabited wastes afford few places where that shelter and refreshment can be obtained which the lady and yourself may perchance stand in need of, —- I have, at some distance from this spot, on the skirts of the forest, a house; if it please you to accept the accommodations it offers, they are at your service; and believe me, signor, you'll find a hearty welcome in't."</DiaM>

His offer was accepted with many thanks. Rudolpho now placed the lady on her horse, and then, vaulting on his own, they moved forward on their journey; the stranger's servant having taken up one of the torches that lay on the earth, and riding before to conduct and light them on their way.

For some time they continued to travel toward a road that wound through the forest: at length they entered, pursued for a considerable time its winding track, and, as they rode along, with pleasing discourse beguiled the tediousness of the way. While thus proceeding, suddenly in a turn of the road, at the foot of a tree at a little distance before them, they descried a something -— what it was, could not, in the darkness, be distinguished; but, on approaching nearer, they perceived that it was the body of a female, to all appearance deprived of life. On her pallid countenance sat the ashy-colored livery of death.

<DiaM>"Almighty God!" <M>exclaimed the stranger, springing from the back of his horse</M>, "'tis my daughter! —- 'tis Rosalthe! Unfortunate that I am, to see my child, -— my darling hope, —- thus nipped in her very blossom! -— Oh, Rosalthe! Rosalthe! thou hearest not thy wretched father call thee! -— Would to God thou didst; my cries should wake thee from the dead! -- Alas! she is cold —- dead and cold!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Her pulse moves!" <M>exclaimed Rudolpho, who had alighted from his horse</M>. -- "Her pulse moves, though but faintly, yet sufficient to prove the breath of life still remains."</DiaM>

All assisted in every endeavour to recall her scattered senses. At length, to the unspeakable delight and satisfaction of the stranger, their efforts succeeded: -- the warm blush of returning life animated, and by degrees drove from her countenance, the livid paleness which had till then usurped its place on her cheek. Opening her eyes, she cast them wildly on Rudolpho, who supported her.

<DiaM>"Where am I?" <M>she exclaimed</M>. —- "Methought ....Merciful Heavens, 'tis the count Verucci, my father! —- Oh, my father!" <M>she added, after a pause during which she was greatly agitated</M> -— "Oh, my father, I have much to say! -— though it rives the very heart in my bosom, yet I'll tell thee! -- Lorenzo, dear unfortunate youth, is dead -— I saw him fall beneath their murderous daggers."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Dead!" <M>interrupted her father</M>, "dead! say you? —- What! Lorenzo dead? -— Alas, poor youth! thou deservedst a better fate! — Tell me, Rosalthe, if thou canst, the particulars."</DiaM>

<DiaInset1P>"Trust me, father," <M>she replied</M>, "'tis a melancholy tale I have to deliver. —- Immediately as we found ourselves alone, with a hope of overtaking you we spurred on our horses. At intervals Lorenzo called loudly on your name; but you were, as he conjectured, at too great a distance to hear his voice. -— We were galloping onward with rapid pace, when, from among the trees on either side, rushed forth a band of robbers. Lorenzo attempted to defend me -- lifeless on the earth I saw him sink. Overpowered by the sight, I lost all sense. -— Would to Heaven I had remained for ever in that insensible state! —- When I again recovered my recollection, I found myself in a lofty and capacious cavern, whose hollow passages and vaulted roof echoed with my screams, till the fierce deportment and menaces of the banditti, who, I found, had brought me hither, terrified me into silence. -— After giving me in strict charge to a withered beldam, they went forth through an iron door, which they carefully locked, and carried the key with them.

"Some hours had now elapsed, and the banditti were not yet returned, though every moment was expected to bring them, when I heard a voice, and instantly after a loud rattling of armour. Terrified, I looked toward the place whence the sound proceeded, and beheld a man of tall and portly figure, accoutred in complete armour. -— In him I found a friend. —- He endeavoured by every effort in his power to force a passage for my escape, but in vain: —- every attempt proved fruitless, till, after many trials and difficulties overcome, at length, with amazing strength, and the help of an axe, he forced back the lock of the iron door that hitherto had precluded my escape. The old woman to whom I was left in charge, affrighted by the threats of my deliverer, conducted us, though much against her inclination, to the stable of the robbers. Fortunately, we found two of their horses; he placed me on one, and mounted on the other himself. We rode forth into the forest at full speed, being fearful, that, when the banditti were returned, they should pursue us.

"We were bewildered for some time: at last we found a road. —- Chance threw in our way a traveler, who directed us on the road that led from the forest. Some time had passed since he had quitted us, when my brave deliverer was attacked, sword in hand, by a troop of horsemen. The darkness being somewhat diminished, I recognised, in the scowling brow and murky visage of him who led them, one of the most ferocious of those robbers who had detained me. Surprised and terrified at the discovery, I slipped from my horse, and, unpursued, ran from them. Thus far had I proceeded, when my strength failed me. The terror and apprehension I felt of being again seised, threw me into that state in which you found me. Whatever has become of Manfredi, for that was the name of my deliverer...."</DiaInset1P>

The name caught the ear of Rodolpho, and he eagerly interrupted her by his inquiries. The answers she gave, convinced him that it was no other than his friend. All together they proceeded to the spot where the combat had been. On looking round, they discovered a large quantity of blood spilled on the ground, the broken fragments of a sword, and other marks of a furious engagement.

<ChapMarker>CHAP. VI.</ChapMarker>

WITH the blood-thirsty and rapacious disposition which ever marks with strong traits of barbarity the ferocious character of banditti, and conducts them forward to commit on those that have the misfortune to fall into their merciless clutches such deeds of cruelty —-	of wanton cruelty oft-times -— as human nature shudders to contemplate —- Rudolpho was too well acquainted, to entertain any doubt that by them Manfredi had been inhumanly murdered. His imagination was filled with thoughts representing his friend —- notwithstanding his military skill, Herculean strength of body, and the stern, rugged, but fiery courage, (though ever tempered with prudence and recollection) which Rudolpho knew he possessed -— as having been overpowered by the number of his assailants, who were much too numerous for his single arm to oppose with a probability of success. As the hardy lion, when surrounded by the hunters who on every side have assaulted him, sinks exhausted with his wounds: the fire is dimmed which had before sparkled from his glaring eye-balls, that struck a fearful terror into the breasts of those around him; strengthless, he is no longer able to sustain the attacks of his enemies, one of whom thrusts his weapon to his heart; he falls; and, swimming in blood, yields his life —- even so Rudolpho's vivid fancy pictured Manfredi encircled by the fierce banditti, whom he valiantly resists, till, covered with wounds, and spent with the combat, a dastardly hand from behind strikes him a mortal blow: he sinks to the earth; they, perceiving him fall, rush on, and their repeated blows render him lifeless.

Possessed with this supposition, and convinced of its truth, Rudolpho, assisted by the count Verucci, sorrowfully betook himself to the mournful task of searching for his friend's lifeless corse; but to no purpose: every endeavour to find it proved unsuccessful. This circumstance surprised Rudolpho, and threw him into great perplexity. He knew, that, unless a miracle, wrought by the wonder-working hand of all-powerful Providence, had been interposed to protect him, it was utterly impossible that Manfredi should have escaped with life. He nevertheless entertained a momentary spark of hope -— though there was scarce any appearance of probability to support it -— that he might still be living; but that hope was soon extinguished.

The broken sword, whose blood-stained fragments lay scattered on the earth still wet with blood, attracted his notice. On examining it with attention, it was, he perceived, the very same which his friend had worn. -— This incident confirmed, with additional strength, his former suspicions. He now was satisfied, as was likewise the count, that Manfredi had perished in the encounter.

Juliet, at the very first mention of her father's name by the lady Rosalthe, was  surprised and alarmed. —- She gave way to the melancholy bodings of her affrighted imagination: —- they were, in a slow degree, increased by every succeeding circumstance, till they amounted almost to a certainty. —- Very little doubt now remained respecting her father. —- She supposed him dead. —- His unfortunate end filled her with sorrow; while the not finding his body struck her with surprise. -— The unhappy fate of him who gave her being she lamented with a grief the most poignant.

Rudolpho now expressed a resolution of searching the forest throughout, to discover the murderers of Manfredi, and bring them to an exemplary punishment for their crimes; in which determination he was immediately joined by the count Verucci.

<DiaM>"My every endeavour," <M>added the count</M>, "united with thine, will shortly, I trust, find the retreat to which these villains betake themselves, laden with the spoil of travelers whom they have murdered: that is the place to seise them; and thither it is fitting we should go. However, some time hence, at leisure, we will discourse upon it. Now let us proceed on our way. A longer stay here cannot be of any service. —- Our wearied spirits and exhausted bodies call on us to recruit them speedily; so, therefore, we will forward. To fortune's care we must, perforce, confide our speeding on the morrow."</DiaM>

So saying, after placing his daughter, he leaped up behind her on the horse, while Rudolpho mounted on his.

From the time they had alighted to assist Rosalthe, neither of them had till now remounted. -— They were moving onward, when they heard at some distance a trampling of horses' feet, apparently approaching on full gallop toward them. Quickly after appeared a troop of men on horseback, advancing with the utmost speed.

<DiaM>"By'r lady, 'tis our noble master!" <M>exclaimed the foremost of them, stopping his horse</M>. "Why, lads, it is our master! the lady Rosalthe and Giacomo too!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"How now, ye knaves?" <M>said the count</M>. "What! is it you? Goodly fellows are you not, in good sooth, to leave me benighted here i' th' forest? 'Twas your carelessness that lost our road in't, and occasioned the separation from us of my daughter, and the unfortunate Lorenzo! However, see you never, by offending in the like again, deserve my resentment. Look to't! or, by the holy virgin, you shall feel the weight on't!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Beseech you, noble signor," <M>replied he that first spoke</M>; "we crave your pardon. Be not in anger with us. It was accident, and the darkness of the night, that was the cause of our losing you: after which we found the road that leads to the castle. Thither we hastened; and, having procured lights, we set out in search of you. After a long time, we discovered signor Lorenzo extended senseless on the earth; and truly he was in a perilous bad condition. We raised him from the ground, having perceived some signs of life yet remaining; and between us we conveyed him to the castle. Leaving him there to the care of Pietro, we again went forth to seek for you, fearing some accident had befallen."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Are his wounds mortal?" <M>inquired the count eagerly</M>. "Is there any hope of his recovery?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"They have been examined, my lord," <M>answered the servant</M>, "and found to be, though dangerous, yet not so far as to endanger his life."</DiaM>

The lady Rosalthe appeared greatly agitated by this account; insomuch that, had not her father in his arms supported her on the horse, she must have fallen to the earth; but her emotion soon subsided.

The count now dispatched one of his servants before, on full speed, to prepare for their coming, while they followed at a moderate pace. They soon reached the castle, through the opened gates of which they passed into a spacious court; and, having dismounted from their horses, the count led, across a magnificent hall, to an apartment richly adorned, wherein a repast, which the count's numerous servants soon prepared, was served up. They partook, and afterwards retired to enjoy that repose which their fatigue rendered necessary.

Rudolpho, with the assistance of the servants who had conducted him to the apartment which the hospitality of his noble host had ordered to be prepared for him, divested himself of the armour that began to sit rather uneasy, as it had never been off since the time when he and Manfredi had effected their wonderous escape from captivity.

After dismissing the servants, he extended on the couch his manly limbs, oppressed with excessive weariness. It was some time ere he could close his eyes; painful rumination on the untimely fate of Manfredi for a while prevented it. At times a faint hope of his being yet alive, would steal insensibly over his thoughts: but it never lasted; every untoward circumstance crowded upon his recollection, and crushed with its weighty proof each particular idea as soon as it presented itself to his imagination, The unexpected meeting with his loved Juliet in the forest filled his mind with wonder; of that which had been the cause of it he was ignorant; for succeeding events had prevented him from inquiry: at length fatigue closed his wearied eyelids, and in the renovating bond of gentle slumber fast locked him.</SceneAction>
