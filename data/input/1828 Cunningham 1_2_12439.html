<ChapEpigraph>But as they left the dark’ning heath,
More desperate grew the strife of death.
The English shafts in vallies hail’d,
In headlong charge their horse assail'd;
Front, flank, and rear, the squadrons sweep,
To break the Scottish circle deep.
Sir Walter Scott.</ChapEpigraph>

<SceneAction>The sun was sinking in the west, <Trigger>when</Trigger> a <ChNoNameExternal>Stranger</ChNoNameExternal> seated himself on the summit of one of the Cheviot hills, and looked anxiously on the land below. The apple was red and ripening on the tree, the nuts were brown in their husks, the rowans’ bitter bunch hung glossy amidst the green bough; the wild plums grew in black and powdery clusters; the sweet green junipers were in full flavour; the nest of the wild bee was filled with

honey; and hill, wood, and dale, showed that summer had fulfilled all the purposes for which nature had given it light and warmth. He saw, too, the sickle in the hands of the reapers moving beneath the ears of yellow corn, the husbandman rubbing the heads in his hand, and looking if the grain was round and ripe; and he heard a song which gave an image of the season, from the lips of two maidens, who bore out food to the harvest field. The green hills presented a similar picture of pastoral abundance. The sunward sides were white over with flocks, shepherds walked among them, thinking on the romantic rivulet bank where the folds stood, and where they could see the maidens at bughting time; from the cheese presses was taken the well-formed and well-pressed curd, and the master of the household weighed the fleece which his flock had yielded, and calculated the growing wealth of his possessions. Away on the Stranger’s left rolled the wide and restless sea, with all its winding outline of coast; and on his right many a feudal castle displayed its banner, while the arms of the warders gleamed bright in the descending sun.

The Stranger gazed awhile on the varied scene, and said, <Monologue>“Alas! green isle, had a brazen wall begirt thee, it would not have shut out slaughter. The south oppresses the north, and the north re-

#3#

sists in bitterness and blood. Never will my native isle have happiness, till one trumpet warns its people to war, till they sing to the sound of the same pipe, till they bow to the breath of the same law, till they eat at the same table, and drink of the same cup. Then shall her united strength make the nations be just, then shall her ships cover the ocean, and she shall be empress of the deep."</Monologue> He uttered this in the calm and confident tone of one who gives judgment rather than expresses a wish, or hazards an opinion. He still continued to look at the scene before him.

Upon this quiet and happy land, war, even as he looked, was let loose. The hills above and the dales below were suddenly filled with armed men. The ridges of the uplands were bristled with spears, and gleamed bright with swords; and so close and compactly were they placed, that the feather which dropt from the wood pigeon’s wing, as it flew, startled away, could fall nowhere but on a warhorse, a basnet, or a shield. The army which occupied the vale below seemed conducted with great prudence, and led by one wise and skilful in the art of war. Their pointed spears gleamed as they moved onward, their swords, drawn from the sheaths, shone sharp and broad, their quivers of arrows rattled as they came, and their burnished helmets and polished mail, touched by the hori-

#4#

zontal light of the sun, made the vale glow <Metaphor>like a sea of agitated fire.</Metaphor> The armies seemed well matched in numbers, enthusiasm, and discipline. Though they were in truth one people, and though a small stream divided their lands, their hostility was fierce, and they spared neither their noblest nor their bravest, when the trumpet was blown, and the national banner displayed. They were now about to increase the stream with blood, which ran clear and dimpling in the sun between them.

<ChPhoto>The Stranger, who witnessed the marching of the two armies, seemed a man of middle age, well knit, and formed for feats of activity and strength. His hair, long and black, descended in masses upon his shoulders, and his look was so calm, his face so pale, and he sat so still and motionless, that he seemed a statue rather than a man. He wore a close dress of gray woollen cloth; a mantle of the same colour was fastened with a silver clasp over his bosom, and a bonnet with a feather from the wing of the heron lay on the grass at his side. At a narrow belt hung a small ivory horn, and a short spear with a head of polished steel, and a shaft of root-grown ash was in his right hand.</ChPhoto>

A trumpet blew in the vale, it was answered from the hill, and the armies rushed together just as the sun was touching with its edge the summits

#5#

of the hills. From the low grounds there flew a close and incessant shower of arrows, so sharp and so strongly drawn, that no armour could resist their descent, while a slow and inconstant discharge from cannon and culverin showed that the art of destruction by gunpowder was yet in its infancy. Against this missile war, swords were drawn and spears were levelled, and the strife for awhile was fierce and desperate. To one acquainted with the warlike nature of the nations of the earth, and their modes of attack and resistance, this contest presented an image of England and Scotland deeply emblazoned with the characters of the two countries. There came Scotland, impatient and ireful, from the declivity of the hill, her thistled banner spread to the wind, her tartans rustling with her rapid steps, her long sharp lance in her hand, and a mingled prayer to God and Saint Andrew on her lips: and there stood England on the vale below, her yew bow in her left hand, with which she thrice conquered France and all her chivalry, the feathered shaft drawn close to her right ear, and her practised and patient eye measuring the distance, and marking the deadly place where her arrow should enter.

The eye of the Stranger knew every pennon that was spread, and the name of every knight who urged his steed to the contest. <Monologue>“Yonder," <M>he said,</M>

#6#

"glitters the royal banner of Scotland, and beneath it fights James Stuart, with half the noble youths of his realm. The Douglas, the Lindsay, the Herries, the Home, and the Gordon; I see them, and I know them all. And there moves the banner of England, with the valour and the wisdom of the Howards, the fire of the Stanleys, and the daring of the Bulmers and the Beaumonts to guide and guard it. Alas for Scotland! when England shoots her cloth-yard shafts, and charges with all her chivalry."</Monologue>

As he uttered this the two banners approached each other, and many a gallant man was stricken to the earth; many a warrior was unhorsed; there was many a prisoner taken, and many a rescue made. On one part the arrows descended <Metaphor>in a close and glittering shower,</Metaphor> and on the other the barbed warhorses and their armed riders poured to the attack <Metaphor>like a torrent of gleaming steel.</Metaphor> The stranger rose, shaded the sun from his eyes with his hand, and looked intently on the contest. The English pressed eagerly forward; their best and bravest warriors were there, and the hope of taking the King, and conquering the royal standard, animated and urged them to the attack. This, however, seemed no easy task. Against the lines of Scottish spears the southern chivalry spurred their horses, and struck with their bills in vain; through

#7#

many a gallant bosom the lance was stricken, and many a saddled and bridled horse ran masterless over the hills.

But from the ranks of Scotland the English arrows singled out noble after noble, and leader after leader, and scarce a man of note was left to guard the royal banner, save <ChNoNameExternal>a single knight</ChNoNameExternal> whose enthusiasm and bravery inspired all around him. He was sheathed completely in mail, his helmet was without a plume, his visor down, and without a cognizance. But the extraordinary courage and skill with which he fought, and the deeds which he did, drew many a gallant soldier to his side, and actions were performed by common hands which were worthy of heroes. The fortune of the day was too well decided to be thus retrieved. The royal banner was beaten to the ground, and soiled with mire and blood; and the knight who defended it was borne to the earth sore wounded with an arrow, and many a good soldier beside him.

The sun had been for some time set, the stars were bright, the harvest moon was nigh the full, and had just shewed her light above the Cheviot hills, when a thick darkness fell at once from the sky, and a man could not see his hand as he held it before him to grope out his way. The English retired from the attack, and left the Scottish stand-

#8#

ard on the ground, and the knight swooned in his blood beside it.

The Stranger hastened down Cheviot side, passed the English archers as they stood in their ranks with their right hands dropt from the half-drawn strings, and went fearless and unchallenged through the cavalry of Cheshire, as the riders returned, cursing the thick darkness which prevented them from seizing the standard and taking the King.

<DiaM>"It is ever the way of these wily Scots," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a veteran from Chester</ChNoNameIntro></M>; "they begin to fight about sunset, that they may run away under the cloud of night when they are sure of being beaten."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Aye," <M>responded <ChNoNameIntro>a soldier from York,</ChNoNameIntro></M> "and they have friends too, man, such as the bowmen of Cheshire, or the billman of the East Riding cannot find when the bugle blows for battle. Did ye ever behold such thick darkness; ye may grope it, man, ye may cut it with your sword. This is none of nature’s deeds, but a magical covering thrown over these crouching Scots by their great magician to secure their retreat. I’ll wager my steel-pommelled saddle against a Scotchman’s straw sonkes, that this infernal cloud would turn a flight of cloth-yard shafts, as effectually as steel mail."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Strike him, strike him with your lance," <M>shouted <ChNoNameIntro>a soldier,</ChNoNameIntro></M> "strike that skulking Scot, on

#9#

your right hand, else he will steal your gray steed from under you."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Strike whom," <M>replied the soldier, looking eagerly round;</M> "I see only thy foolish self."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Then may the saints soon send me out of this enchanted ground," <M>answered the man of York</M>; "I saw a man with matted hair, bareheaded and bare-footed, pass between us, even now. There be wizards or fiends on Flodden-edge."</DiaM>

The Stranger, to whom this speech referred, passed to the ground where the concluding contest had been. He lifted the royal banner and unfurled it to the wind again. He looked on the knight as he lay in his blood, whose prowess for awhile had made the victory doubtful. He stooped silently over him, withdrew the well used sword from his right hand, unbuckled his rich and polished mail, and undid the clasps of his visor. The knight lay motionless; the blood flowed freely from his wounds, and stained anew the grass where he was extended. He took him gently in his arms, prayed over him for a little space, poured a clear liquid from a small phial upon his head, and said, "Arise Sir James, time was, time is, and may soon be no more; arise, thou hast proved thy fortune." When he had done speaking Sir James rose from the ground as freshly and firmly as though he had

#10#

never been wounded. He looked on the dead and dying, and said, <DiaQ>"Here warred I to-day amongst the chivalry of Scotland, and warred unhappily. Am I alone left living of all that royal host — where is Home, Gordon, Maxwell, and Douglas?"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Fled — captive — slain," <M>was the concise answer of the Stranger, who stood with his arms folded over his bosom, and regarded the living knight and the groups of slaughtered gentlemen and nobles as a husbandman would regard a field of new mown hay.</M></DiaM> <DiaM>"The Douglas never flies," <M>replied Sir James</M>; "and the Maxwell never yields; the Gordon is ever victorious; and who ever saw the sword of Home backward in Scotland’s battles?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Sir James," <M>said the Stranger,</M> "most truly have you characterised them. The Douglas never flies, and the Maxwell never yields — there their bodies lie as they were pierced in defence of their King and the honour of their country. For the Gordon and the Home would you know where they are?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Most gladly," <M>answered Sir James,</M> "it must have been a field which valour could not retrieve when those gallant soldiers fled."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Even so," <M>replied the Stranger</M>.</DiaM>

The thick darkness which till now had covered hill and dale rolled suddenly away in the direction of Scotland, and Sir James looked and saw the unbroken bands of Gordon and Home retir-

#11#

ing beneath the light of the moon which beamed out on their path without an interposing cloud. <DiaM>"Alas!" <M>said the knight,</M> "and of all the army are these the sole survivors! Ah Flodden-field, sorrowful will thy name be amongst the maidens of the low country — and in many a tale and song will they be honoured who fell here beneath the shafts and swords of the enemies of Scotland."</DiaM> <DiaM>"You mourn not for the King of your country, Sir Knight," <M>said the other</M>; "know ye not that James Stuart lies trodden as stiff as that bloody turf beneath the hoofs of Howard’s horsemen?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"I mourn not for him, peasant," <M>answered Sir James</M>; "the meanest hind that bled for him was worthier than he. To his base love and his senseless chivalry the blood of his people has been poured idly out; for had he led his soldiers like a man, and not like a knight-errant, the blood which swells the stream at Twisel-bridge would have been that of the Howards and their English churls."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The blood of the English, Sir Knight," <M>replied the Stranger,</M> "was periled freely, and as freely was it spilt by the lances of the Yarrow, the Annan, and the Kith. But in Scotland will James Stuart the Fourth never reign more, and were he to be raised from this bloody field, and the breath of heaven poured into his nostrils, how could his proud vain nature meet the looks of his insulted

#12#

nobles; and how could his tender heart endure to hear mothers weeping, and widows lamenting, and maidens wailing, and asking him for their sons, their husbands, and their lovers?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"You have expressed the monarch’s character honestly and truly," <M>said the knight.</M> "You have said that the blood of England was poured freely out. I see none of her sons either living or dead."</DiaM>

The Stranger turned his face to the south, where <Metaphor>the thick cloud of night</Metaphor> seemed reaching from heaven to earth, <Metaphor>as black as a raven’s wing,</Metaphor> and <Metaphor>as dense as a wall.</Metaphor> <DiaM>"Hearest thou nothing, Sir James?" <M>he enquired.</M></DiaM> The sound of mirth and revelry rose suddenly on all sides. The cloud passed slowly away, the moon sent down her stream of pure and uninterrupted light, and the southward valley was visible for several miles. The knight looked, and there he saw the Chester chivalry heaped horse and man, where they rushed upon the Scottish spears; their billmen lay like mown grass, and their bowmen rank succeeding rank, where the swords of Gordon and Home had stopt the flight of their shafts for ever. <DiaM>"Well and worthily they bore them," <M>said the knight;</M> "see how soldier-like they lie each with his fatal yew-tree in his hand, and a shaft half plucked from the quiver."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Look a little farther," <M>said the Stranger.</M></DiaM>

Sir James looked, and his colour changed, for

#13#

he beheld the men of England — their ranks unbroken — their banners floating proudly on the night wind, and their pavilions pitched without either watch or ward. <DiaM>"They are the conquerors," <M>he said, bitterly,</M> "and therefore may dispense with the precautions of men when an enemy is nigh. Oh for one hour of that gallant army on which I looked so proudly at mid-day! they would lend the vale another sound than that of wassail mirth and victors’-shouts."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Cry your war-cry, and see if it will raise them from their bloody beds," <M>said the Stranger</M>; "now of a truth may men know you are a Scotchman—thou art wise too late."</DiaM> As he spoke, the shouts of the English increased more and more.

<DiaM>"Here’s to thee, Will Howard," <M>exclaimed a rough, bold voice.</M> "Thou art a puller down of kings."</DiaM> The shout was long in subsiding which followed this toast. <DiaM>"And here’s to George Beaumont," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a Tynedale knight,</ChNoNameIntro> springing to his feet,</M> "a truer hand ne’er drew a bow, and stouter heart ne’er shot a shaft."</DiaM> The loud welcome with which the toast was received, shewed the love of the soldiers for that gallant name. <DiaM>"And shall we forget Ned Stanley and his Cheshire horse?" <M>shouted <ChNoNameIntro>a third knight.</ChNoNameIntro></M> "The billmen of Howard can give a good stroke, and the archers of Beaumont can shoot a sharp shaft; but when the swords

#14#

of Ned Stanley came to the northern bosoms, they fell or fled, and left their noblest behind them."</DiaM> Many a steel helmet was waved in the air, and many a gory sword in honour of the noble name.

<DiaM>"How like you the sight, Sir James," <M>thus questioned the Stranger,</M> "and how like you the sound?"</DiaM> The knight snatched his sword from the ground, and exclaimed: <DiaQ>"I have heard and seen enough. Peasant stand from my path; for the war-cry of Stanley you shall hear a wail when I enter yon proud tent. My country will never see me more, nor know that I did a knightly deed, and died as a brave man should."</DiaQ> The other laid his hand on his arm, and said, mildly, <DiaQ>"Death cannot now be found, and thou art not yet worthy to die. A well-fought field for thy country’s sake, and the shout of victory in thy ear cannot be thine. Follow me."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"And who art thou," <M>demanded Sir James,</M> "that I am thus commanded to do as thou wilt. I follow no churl — who art thou, and what is thy name?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"I am as thou seest, James," <M>was the answer;</M> "let thine eyes judge whether I am a man or no. My name among men is Michael — a worthy king added the title of Sir, but I insist not on it, as it has been bestowed often since on the vain and the vile."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Sir Michael," <M>said Sir James,</M> "I charge thee by thy knighthood to tell me, am I a prisoner. I

#15#

fought till I fell through loss of blood, and since then till now I am ignorant of what has happened."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Thou art free from all bonds save those of sin and folly," <M>replied Sir Michael</M>. "In fight I saw thee acquit thyself worthily, and to no man didst thou yield one foot of ground."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Then," <M>answered Sir James,</M> "My purpose is fixed. I shall go down to these victors, and do one deed of valiantness, and die."</DiaM>

And he went forward, where many a fair face lay cold in the moonlight — the sword, the axe, the lance, the bill, and the arrow had heaped the field; and Sir James, who loved a brave man in life, and reverenced him in death, walked slowly along, nor touched a corse with his feet of either friend or enemy. There lay two bodies face to face, their swords had inflicted mutual wounds, and death had stamped on their looks the fury which in life inspired them. He glanced at them, and passed on. An ancient warrior sat against a stone, his head had dropped on his bosom, and his bloody sword was still in his hand. His face was rough with the scars of other battles, and though transfixed with a lance, his look was calm and determined. At his feet lay the body of a youth whom he had slain, his golden tresses came curling out from below his helmet, a broken sword lay beside him, and in his bosom was a lock of fair hair, which at sun-rise

#16#

had shone on the neck of his love. Sir James sighed, and passed onward. He came to the place where the barbed war-horses of England had charged the men of Teviot and Yarrow. There lay six hundred young warriors as they dropped in their ranks, and beside them the chivalry of Chester and Durham scattered as thick as forest leaves in November.

<Monologue>"Ah, my gallant lads of the forest," <M>said Sir James,</M> "had a wise head led your valour, the maidens of Yarrow would have welcomed you back with garlands and songs. There you lie — truer hearts never drew swords, and long shall the border bewail the fall of the Flowers of the Forest, and sing how the southern swords have wede them away."</Monologue> He reached now the skirts of the battle field. A wounded soldier had retired from the bloody press to the side of a brooklet, and stooped down to slake his thirst in the stream. But there life failed him — he had dropped forward; his lips seemed touching the water, and his blood was still mingling with the current. To a far different scene Sir James now directed his looks. Before him was the hasty encampment of the victors, where joy and sorrow were strangely mingled.

An hundred fires were kindled on the ground, and round each fire sat a group of soldiers, driving on the song and the wine cup, recounting their

#17#

actions, and praising their own prowess. <DiaM>"Look at this little crooked piece of wood," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a Tynedale archer</ChNoNameIntro>, holding up his bow,</M> "thirty-six clothyard shafts sang from this loom to day, and Scotland lost three dozen of her children. Ah, the brown yew-tree and the steel-headed shaft for ever."</DiaM> <DiaM>"A good head-piece and mail-coat regard your arrows no more than the stings of as many wasps," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a billman of Durham</ChNoNameIntro></M>; "such a plaything as that may do for quelling the wild Scottish men of the mountains, who have not the sense to wear steel garments. But what would your birdbolts have done with a head-piece of steel full fifteen pounds weight, which this little weapon of mine clove to-day on the head of its owner?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"And what is either arrow or bill," <M>cried <ChaNoNameIntro>a third,</ChaNoNameIntro></M> "to be compared to a good sharp lance and a well-bitted horse? Ah, with this little active bit of Ripon steel I have pierced many a shield, and bored many a corslet."</DiaM> And the soldier shook a long gory lance in the moonlight. <DiaM>"And what is shaft, spear, or bill, compared to a good brown sword, forged in a charcoal fire, and tempered in a wolf’s blood," <M>exclaimed <ChNoNameIntro>a warrior from Westmoreland</ChNoNameIntro></M>: "an arrow is a cowardly thing; a bill is only for the strong and the stupid; a lance is good, but the horse wins half the honour from the rider. Commend me to a short sharp sword; it is the thing

#18#

for a man of soul and science, it is a gentleman’s weapon, and only three men in the island know how to handle it. One is Will Howard of Raby; one is James Stuart of Scotland, and the other, I shall let my friends and my enemies name him, but gaze on that, and guess."</DiaM> And he flourished his sword proudly in the air.

Apart from these warriors was seated a motley company of soldiers and sutlers, drivers of waggons, monks, and women. The wine cup and ale flagon circulated with great celerity, and they talked, sung, prayed, swore, and shouted, forming a kind of compound din, which expressed confusion of body and mind, better than any image which invention could supply. <DiaM>"Let the wine cup go round," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a soldier</ChNoNameIntro>, who balanced himself with difficulty,</M> "it is all the reward a poor fellow gets for knocking the enemies of old England on the head — let it go round, Sir Monk; stay not the generous liquid with one of your idle prayers."</DiaM> <DiaM>"I was but breathing out the blessing of Saint Wilfred over the good wine," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>the monk,</ChNoNameIntro></M> "in order that it might do its good duty, with a sinful layman, who slays men’s bodies and repents not."</DiaM> <DiaM>"A plague on thee, priest," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a soldier,</ChNoNameIntro> who took his lip from the cup that he might give better vent to his anger,</M> "a plague on thee, priest. Dost thou talk of God to a soldier, whose whole occupation

#19#

is in cutting throats? Place me an armed Scottishman before your abbey door, and try whether your prayer or my pike will conjure him away soonest."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Let the good monk speak, I pray thee, Simon," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>one of the dames of the camp</ChNoNameIntro>,</M> "he is a charitable and benevolent man; he feeds the poor at the abbey gate, and cheers the hearts of the soldiers’ wives when their husbands are warring on the borders. He is a good man, and loves to see a fair face, and a full cup, and mirth in merry old England."</DiaM> <DiaM>"A fair character, monk," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>another of the group</ChNoNameIntro></M>; "hast thou had good luck to day in confessing and forgiving opulent sinners? Ah! many a fair piece of gold has the eve of battle cost me; an acquittance for mortal sin is an expensive item to a scrupulous conscience."</DiaM> The monk was one of those joyous personages who could chaunt profane songs, sing devout hymns, tell a wild tale, pray a long prayer, and bandy about the jest and the blow; and this made his company much more welcome than that of a wiser man.

<DiaM>"Priest," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a soldier,</ChNoNameIntro> striking the cup from his lip with the staff of his lance,</M> "lay aside that comrade of thine, he will run away with thy wit and thy mirth, and make thee dull and devout. Wilt thou tell me, for I know thou hast warred with the devil in thy day, what hand he has in the

#20#

thick darkness which came over the battle, and now falls over the camp. I am but a lame guesser, Sir Priest, but I think old Michael Scott himself has taken Scotland’s part to day."</DiaM> The monk shook his head, looked as grave, and sat as steady as he could, and said, <DiaQ>"the devil I defy, and Michael Scott I despise, for I carry that about me which confounds alike fiend and wizard. Behold a paring of the hind hoof of the prophet Balaam’s ass, after its mouth was opened; from this incomparable relic all that is not of God flies as darkness flies before the light of morning."</DiaQ> And he unrolled it with much care, and a great show of respect, and held it up in the gleam of the bickering fire. <DiaM>"Sir Priest, it wont pass muster; this relic of thine," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a soldier,</ChNoNameIntro></M> "is apocryphal; thou livest too near Gaffer Weldon’s forge to go far for the paring of a horse’s hoof. No ass had ever so large a foot as this has formed a part of."</DiaM> The monk took the relic, looked at it gravely, and said, <DiaQ>"O sinful man, seven score stripes shall my bare body endure to night for this. Soldier, thou sayest well, it is the paring of a horse’s hoof. St. George, forgive me for mistaking a relic from the forefoot of thy blessed steed on which thou slewest the dragon, for that of a meaner creature!"<Descriptor>The merry faces of the soldiers persuaded the priest that he was before an audience slow to believe in such mysterious

#21#

things; and, fertile in expedients, he thus sought to cover the retreat of his relic, and it is but justice to his invention to say, that he succeeded.</Descriptor>

"What I have to say," <M>said the monk,</M> "will drive the mirth from all faces. Once on a time, some three hundred years ago, when Michael Scott the wizard was a holy monk as I am, he had a journey to go, and he took his scrip and his staff, a cruse of water, and some dried peas, the only food which our order eats, but it is eaten thankfully, and we wax as lusty as though we dined on the fatness of the land, and drank the richest of the vintage. The devil came to Michael by the way, and tempted him, and taunted him, and there was a sore strife between them. But Michael vanquished the enemy, and drove him away, and went on his journey. Now it chanced that Michael waxed weary, and when his feet became sore, he looked, and there stood a beautiful black palfrey ready saddled on the road before him. Now as it pleaseth the saints often to work wonders in aid of their faithful servants, the palfrey seemed to that holy man as a steed sent to comfort him, and he leapt on its back, and pursued his journey. But Michael soon felt and knew that he rode upon the fiend, and by a power which the pious only possess, he disarmed his infernal steed of all strength to do him harm. When he reached his journey’s end,

#22#

he led him into Fountain’s abbey forge, and had four heavy iron shoes clinked upon his feet; the devil was lame for a year and a day; the smith that shod him went raving mad, and bequeathed this paring of his hoof to the abbey as a token that holiness had conquered the fiend."</DiaQ> And he held up the relic, and then replaced it in his scrip.

<DiaM>"Bravo, priest, thou shalt have another cup for that, God! and thou art a good one!" <M>exclaimed <ChNoNameIntro>several soldiers,</ChNoNameIntro> half choking with laughter, and the cup and the flagon moved rapidly round.</M></DiaM>

Sir James and his companion saw another group seated beneath some elm-trees. They were a few of the more active and prudent spirits of the army, whose love of blood was tempered by love of gain, and whose valour never got the better of their presence of mind. They could calculate the value of the gold upon a helmet before they struck it with the sword, and see in imagination the riches of a city, in the moment they were storming the walls. By the light of the moon they arranged and apportioned their spoils. All around them lay rich mantles, costly helmets, fine coats of mail, swords with jewelled hilts, and cups of silver and gold; nor had those spoils been obtained without resistance; they were wet with blood, and had been recently torn from the baggage and the bodies of the slain. <DiaM>"See!" <M>said Sir Michael</M>, "there they

#23#

sit sordidly dividing the bloody relics of battle, — the hawk and the crow will gorge them and begone, but these human vultures blood alone cannot appease."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Those Scots," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a soldier,</ChNoNameIntro> who was dividing the booty,</M> "those Scots, to be a poor people, seem to have a very pretty notion of their own in going to war; they carry all their riches about them, and when they fall beneath the arrow or the sword, a handy fellow finds some good gleanings. Here are some passable trinkets. This sword with the diamonds in its golden handle; this garment embroidered with thistles of gold, and this little drinking cup and dagger, have belonged to some leader of note and name. Let us offer them up at the shrine of our Ladye at York, so that we may prosper in our wars, and be blest with the sack of some rich city as a reward of our piety."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Nay, nay, Luke," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a fellow soldier,</ChNoNameIntro></M> "we cannot afford so rich a bribe to old mother Merciful at York; she will take the gift and gape for more, and never heed the prayers of a poor soldier, let him pray ever so stoutly for a short skirmish and much booty. Why honest Gib Middyltone was hanged at Durham, though he laid as much red gold on our Ladye’s shrine, as would have purchased remission for stealing a relic of the real cross, or Beckett’s bloody stone. Old mother Church has a greedy swallow, and we must

find a cheaper retailer of forgiveness, — a church that wont herry a man’s house to give him hopes of heaven."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Coome, coome, Rafe," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>one of his comrades</ChNoNameIntro> in a soothing tone,</M> "a truce with thy jibes; no one cries so lustily as thyself for the aid of the saints when thou comest to perilous knocks, and truly the saints must be tender-hearted to save such a subject as thee, the last to give battle, and the foremost at the spoil! coome, coome, Rafe, be moderate, and let our Ladye have her share."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I grudge not the share of our Ladye," <M>answered Ralph,</M> "if she would be considerate; but there is ne’er a saint in the calendar who would not give such handy servants his protection for a smaller offering. But let her have it; one word more, comrades, I shall make the offering myself!"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Thou make the offering!" <M>exclaimed Luke,</M> "when didst thou grow so honest as to be trusted with the goods of either saint or sinner? Well! I wot our Ladye will get little if we confide her share to thee. Nay, nay, there is a holy hermit hard by, who goes on a weekly pilgrimage to her shrine; we will let him be the bearer, and then we may look for blessings to follow."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Bravo, Luke," <M>cried Ralph;</M> "this holy hermit of thine, is as stark a knave as lives between Scotland and Scarborough, and no one knows him bet-

ter than thyself, seeing he is thy born brother. If there is a house herried in the hundred, the hermit comes in for his share. But hilloa! sword, robe, cup, and dagger, where are they? conjured clearly away by the mass. Ralph, didst thou do it by magic or slight of hand?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"By slight of hand," <M>exclaimed Ralph, giving his comrade a blow with his fist, that made him stagger</M>; "but whither are the gifts for our Ladye gone? I took them from the hands of a dying soldier, who told me they belonged to bold King James himself. I saw no one come — I saw no one go, and yet they are vanished like a devil’s gift; moved off as cleanly as if old Michael the magician had done it."</DiaM> <DiaM>"I saw something," <M>said <ChNoNameIntro>a soldier,</ChNoNameIntro> with a shudder,</M> "I saw a dark shadow between me and the moon. I have heard old hermit Selby say, that the arms of the King of Scotland were made in fairy-land, by Michael Scott, and that they never would be won in battle, let England fight ever so stoutly."</DiaM>

The soldiers huddled closely together, overcome with terror, and he who remembered a prayer thought himself happy.</SceneAction>

<ChapEpigraph>It had much of glamour might,

<SceneDia>Sir Michael stood by the side of Sir James with the robe, the sword, the cup, and the dagger, of the King of Scotland in his hand. The knight looked anxiously upon them, then glanced his eye on the startled soldiers, and said to his companion in a low voice, <DiaQ>"Give back these baubles to those who took them. Why would ye rob the soldier of the spoil he has honourably won?"</DiaQ>" <DiaM>"James," <M>answered the other,</M> "you speak as your gross sight informs you; I act as the mind directs. He who bore these in battle last, bore them not unworthily, for he was a brave prince, but he obeyed the dark glances of fair dames; he was a slave to sight which is sensual; and a lady’s smile won more from his hand than the words of gray-headed

wisdom. This sword and dagger, robe and cup, are too pure to be polluted by vulgar hands. They were made for the great Robert Bruce, when he warred for Scotland’s freedom; with this good blade he dyed the brook of Bannock, and wearing this robe he dispensed righteous judgment and prudent mercy among his people. Judge ye, therefore, if it be meet that such things should be profaned by common hands. Even out of this act shall I read you a lesson fit for a prince to hear. These spoils would have proved the ruin of these men. Over them, blades would have been bared, and life’s blood spilt. I spared these men, to be a scourge to the rich priests and opulent nobles of this haughty land."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I know these spoils right well," <M>said Sir James,</M> "and common legends say that the sword was forged in a fairy fire, and the robe wrought in a fairy loom. Such is the tale of our poetic peasantry. For me, any blade that can cut through a steel casque, or any robe that keeps a soldier from the night dew, is as good as aught forged in visionary fires, or woven in imaginary looms."</DiaM> Sir Michael smiled, and answered, <DiaQ>"James, thou wert ever an unbeliever, and with the King didst scorn the spirit which came to warn him from the war; like him, too, thou didst slight the terrible voice which summoned all the nobles afterwards slain at

#28#

Flodden-edge, to answer at the judgment-seat. Thou wilt change thy creed before the green hills of Scotland feel thy feet again. Thou art doomed to a severe pilgrimage."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"It will be a strange journey," <M>replied the knight,</M> "which can make me believe that this old war-worn robe is of supernatural weft, and this little sharp broad blade is not a piece of good Damascus steel. But I am glad I have the good sword once more in my hand. I wish to die as a soldier should. Here is the tent of Surrey, and thus I confront the nobles of England who mocked and scorned in song and jest the romantic valour of James Stuart."</DiaM> With his robe thrown over his left arm, and his sword held before him, he was about to rush into the tent, when a grasp from which there was no escape suddenly fixed him to the place.

<DiaM>"James," <M>said Michael, sternly,</M> "know that thou hast no longer thy own wild will on earth. I am commissioned to save thy body from the sword, and thy soul from perdition; and thou must take Counsel of me, and do even as I bid thee. If I leave thee, a bloody corse or in ignominious captivity wilt thou be, ere three strokes are stricken with thy sword. Enter not the tent."</DiaM> Sir James stept back and exclaimed, <DiaQ>"By what token am I to credit this wild tale of thine? Show me some-

#29@

thing by which I may judge if thou deceivest me or no; thou hast been much my friend hitherto."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Look around thee, James," <M>said the other</M> "and tell me what thou seest."</DiaM> <DiaM>"See," <M>said the knight, gazing hastily around,</M> "I see the dead lying under the moon on Flodden-edge. Accursed am I for not dying where the Douglas and the Lindsay died. And I see the unfurled flags and glittering tents of the victors before me. I can hear their ribald songs, and their haughty vaunts- What else have I to see?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Thy sight is true," <M>said Sir Michael</M>; "such is the scene which to thee this fair vale presents. But what doth the English see? Their gross sight cannot behold what they would give a rich lordship to perceive. They see the dead on Flodden-side; they see the captives who sit guarded in their tents; they see the rich spoils they have taken; but they see not the bold and gallant knight who guarded the royal standard of Scotland, and made such havoc among their golden spurs."</DiaM> <DiaM>"By St. Andrew, I believe thou tellest the truth," <M>said Sir James.</M> "Nay, I am as blind as these southerns are, not to have known this before. No sentinel has challenged me; and here I stand by Surrey’s tent, free and skaithless. This art of thine I would willingly learn, Sir Michael; to be invisible is worth a royal prerogative. To glide

#30#

into the courtier’s privacy, when he is whispering secret treason; to behold the physician spice the poison-cup; the assassin prove the point of his midnight dagger; to enter the forbidden chamber where the couch is soft and the fair one frail; these were blessings worthy of a throne."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"A most unworthy use, James," <M>exclaimed Michael,</M> "thou wouldst make of that hidden art. But thou art not invisible; thou art seen but not known. It is not in the lot of ought corporeal, of ought that has of this earth in it, to dissolve into air, and become as a shadow or breath of wind. Man must become dust before he becomes spiritual, for the flesh dissolves in the grave, and the spirit ascends into heaven, descends into hell, or wanders about the green earth, bewailing its departed joys, and enduring the sight of the sorrows of man as a punishment for its own sins. Thou art therefore still visible. It might mortify thy pride, and read thee a lesson of humility, couldst thou but know what thou seemest in the sight of men."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nay, Michael," <M>said Sir James,</M> "it would do more than that, it would teach me to believe in the spiritual empire of good and evil beings on earth, in which I have but a slender faith even now."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Come then and believe," <M>said Michael</M>; "see, there is a fountain as pure as one of the mirrors of

#31#

Holyrood. The moon just now is looking at her own face in its water; go and behold thyself, and see that thou scarest not the blessed planet which has hitherto ruled thy lot."</DiaM>

The knight ran to the little pool where it lay quiet, and, surrounded by its margin of bright green grass, he looked at his shadow, and started back with affright. He looked all round; he looked at himself; he ventured forward again, and the shape which he beheld gave him such mortal offence, that he plunged his sword into the water, even to the hilt. A wild scream arose from the pool; a strange agitation shook the water; he withdrew his sword, and it was with horror he beheld a drop of dark blood hanging at its point.

<DiaM>"Well and boldly done, thou faithful weapon," <M>said Michael, looking on the sword blade.</M> "I knew when I tempered thee in Arabia that nought evil could abide thy dint. And well and boldly done my servant James; thou art come of a house that never shook at aught; yet thou mightest have trembled at the sight thou sawest."</DiaM> <DiaM>"And I did tremble," <M>said the knight</M>; "I looked in, and the expanding door of hell could have shewn nought more terrible. I saw the faces of all those I had unrighteously slain. I started back with affright. I found courage to look again, and I saw something like the shadow of myself, but grim, hideous,

#32#

and horrible. The water-phantom glared on me; hell was in its eyes, and a smile on its skinny lips. I knew the form; it had appeared to me on that night I passed from Holyrood; it was the evil angel who has had power over me, and in the agony of my heart I plunged my sword in its bosom. Didst thou hear a low shriek? and is that blood on the blade? "</DiaM>

<DiaM>"James, thou speakest truly," <M>answered Sir Michael,</M> "and thou hast foiled the evil spirit which has ruled thy lot since the slaughter at Saughie-burn. Such pain as a reprobate spirit can feel, thou hast inflicted; and well and wisely hast thou used the good sword, which can pierce aught but the blessed shapes of heaven. Hang the blade by thy side, for it becomes thee to wear it. Sit down, and 1 shall tell thee the story of that good weapon. Sit down; thou art as safe within touch of the Howards’ right hand, as if thou satest on Arthur’s seat, with the summer morn shining on Holyrood."</DiaM>

Sir James seated himself beside a little springlet, which leapt from a crevice in the rock into a stone basin, and shone cold and pure in the light of the moon. <DiaInset1P>"I have been a wanderer from my youth," <M>said Michael,</M> "and gained knowledge as wise men did of old, by travelling amongst the nations of the earth, and looking on the ways of men.

It happened in the wild desert, that as I sat and refreshed myself at a little well amidst a clump of palm and date trees, a beautiful wild steed approached the spring, and in an agony of thirst plunged his head into the fountain. He seemed a noble animal, as dark as a raven’s back, without one white hair save a spot in his forehead, and when he ran in the desert, his mane and tail streamed like flame wavering in the wind. As he drank, I laid my hand on his mane, sprang upon his back,—he gave one loud snort, and away he started. I think I feel him beneath me now. The raven of the desert croaked, but pursued us not; the hyena uttered a low growl, and started from our path; and the hermit, whose cavern was between the wilderness and the field of rice, fell on his face, and prayed for my preservation. We came to a vast valley where a battle had been fought, the bones of twenty thousand men lay bleaching in the burning sun. The skulls crunched beneatn the heels of my steed. I looked back, and imagined I beheld all the bones rise into skeletons, and glare after me. Two hungry lions had seized a horse and rider; their victims were bleeding beneath their paws, and they lashed their sides with their tails in token of enjoyment. They sprang from their prey as I came near, and ran howling into the wilderness. A wild Arab had waylaid

#34#

a Christian traveller, and had pulled him to the earth; with his left hand he grasped his hair, and with his right he flourished his scymitar to give the mortal stroke; he beheld the wild steed come; his love of blood over-mastered fear, the horse sprung upon him, crushed him to the earth like a worm, and left him dying on the sands. We came to a forsaken city; its walls were broken down, its majestic temples were mute, its marble tombs were empty, and a hyena stood and looked from a place where oracles had spoken of old. We came nigh to an inland sea; there was wind but no wave, and the water raised no green grass on its margin, nor lilies along its border; no waterfowl were swimming on its surface, neither were there a living thing to be seen. The wild steed gave a neigh of joy, and rushed towards this fearful sea. I prayed, for I thought death was at hand, and suddenly there fell something from a dark cloud which was sailing over us; it gleamed like fire as it descended, and plunged into the sand between the horse’s fore feet. In a moment I was thrown senseless on the sand, and the creature that bore me ran on, and I saw him no more. When I awoke, I saw something glittering beside me, a substance resembling melted steel, and it was hot and burning. I knew it to be what fell from heaven, and I blessed it, and took it up, and bore it with me through the

#35#

desert. I came to the forsaken city, and there sat an old man with a cross before him eating wild figs. I told him all that had befallen, and he fell on his face before me, and said, <DiaQ>'Michael Scott, thou art a favoured one; the steed which bore thee was the unholy spirit, and the brand that fell from heaven was a token that thou art one of the elect. O for that blessed metal which came from above, and O for a fire of heaven’s own kindling, that I might make thee a sword which a demon could not resist.’</DiaQ> And I said, <DiaQ>'Father, here it is;’</DiaQ> and the old man’s face kindled with joy, and he took the rough metal and threw over it a nitrous preparation, and the fire sparkled up, and all the ancient temple of Apollyon was filled with a won-derous light. When he had fashioned the sword, he carried it burning to the entrance of the temple, and waved it to and fro, till it seemed to kindle all the air. Then he ground the blade, and wrought many holy symbols and devices on the sides, and he added a hilt of pure gold, and set it round with precious stones. And when he had finished it he put it into my hand, and said, <DiaQ>'Go, thou favoured one; this blade, wrought in the fire kindled in heaven, tempered in the pure air of God, with its hilt forged of consecrated gold, and covered with the precious stones which adorned the altar of Jerusa-

#36#

lem, will be irresistible in a righteous man’s hand, and neither mortal nor demon will endure its dint.'</DiaQ> I took the sword; it is now at thy side! I have struck the foes of Scotland with it; I have since ridden on that wild steed’s back, and I hope to ride again."</DiaInset1P>

Sir James laid the sword across his knees, looked on it, and said, <DiaQ>"of all wild tales thou hast told me the wildest. Why, this sword was given to Robert the Bruce; it has been watched as a sacred thing by his descendants, and I could know the blade among ten thousand. But if I can believe in the sword, how shall I believe in thee? The good Robert has been with the just these hundred and eighty years, and thou seemest a man in thy prime, nay, art fresh, and lusty, and young; a fellow fit to do battle for a crown; a candidate for a lady’s chamber; such a marvel cannot be."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"From this vale of death, where the nobles of Scotland lie slaughtered, thou shalt never go," <M>answered Michael,</M> "till thou givest credence to me. Dost thou believe that heaven’s hollowness above thee, that earth’s footstool under thy feet, and the deep dark sea that roars upon the wild coast, are not the works of one far mightier than man? Will the moon cease shining, the stream cease rushing, and the grass cease growing, if thou commandest them? Believest thou that fires are below, and blessedness

#37#

above, and that a fiend tempts man, that he may gain his soul? or that God takes delight in the happiness of his creatures? If thou believest in these things, then mayst thou credit much more; thou mayest believe that God, for wise and holy purposes, prolongs man’s life on earth; that he interposes, marvellously to save and redeem nations and families, and that he admonishes and warns man a thousand thousand times, with signs in the sky, with visions on earth, and by dreams when sleep comes on. It pleases Him on high to cut off the oppressor and the troubler in his early career, so it is also his pleasure to prolong the life of those he loves, for the purposes of holiness and virtue."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I see, I understand," <M>replied the knight,</M> "the object of your argument; but occurrences against the course of nature startle and alarm me, and though my sceptic creed has been somewhat rudely shaken of late, I must acknowledge that I cannot wholly believe nor altogether deny the miraculous matters of which you have spoken, and of some of which I have been witness."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Be it so," <M>answered the other;</M> "your unbelief is easily cured, — how happens it that you stand unmolested at the entrance of your enemy’s tent; yet no one strikes you dead, nor lifts a weapon against you."</DiaM> Sir James stood and looked! all around him lay the English

#38#

army, and beside him Lord Surrey called his chiefs to council; he could distinguish each leader, and know what he said.

<DiaM>"Stanley!" <M>said Howard,</M> "your sword struck deeply into the Scottish centre, and you were close to the royal standard; is it true that the King is slain?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Noble Surrey!" <M>answered Stanley,</M> "I saw the King surrounded by the prime of his nobility, contending with lance and sword against our chivalry; many an arrow leapt from his Milan mail coat, and many a lance was stricken against him, yet he fell not, he fled not, and whoso he struck once, molested him no more. It was in truth a noble sight, to behold a warrior so excellent. So fought he when the sun went down; amid the darkness which followed I could see him no longer."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And it was with no good will of mine," <M>said Lord Dacre,</M> "that he fought so long, and that his fate is uncertain. Against him my followers drew the shaft, levelled the lance, and struck with bill and sword, and the brave circle which hemmed him in diminished during my attack; escape he cannot; I beheld him faint and wounded to the death; and had not darkness descended between us, he would now have stood captive within call, even as that strolling minstrel stands at the door of your tent."</DiaM>

#39#

<DiaM>“A minstrel!" <M>said Lord Surrey;</M> "shame to the knight who sits, while a follower of the art divine stands at my tent door. Fitz-Allan and Bulmer, invite him into our tent; let a seat be set at my right hand; place wine and food beside it; for one of the inspired sons of song honours us with his presence."</DiaM> The knights went, and soon returned, ushering in Sir James, accompanied by Sir Michael.

<DiaM>"Sir Minstrel," <M>said Lord Surrey, rising, and motioning Sir James to a seat,</M> "the Howard welcomes you to his side; and never could poet come in a happier hour; for a glorious victory has been won, and a gallant king slain. Here, Ralph Theakston, bring the minstrel my harp; a better instrument his hand never swept; we would gladly hear him sing a song in our honour; honest praise is no flattery."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Noble Howard," <M>answered Sir James,</M> "thy praise in this I may not sing; thy hands are dyed with the blood of my kinsmen; the shouts of victory which lately filled the air were from my country’s enemies, and the groans which I hear even now of the wounded, come from men who share in my love and my blood."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Thou, shuffling Scot, this shall not serve thee," <M>exclaimed Lord Dacre;</M> "sing! else by the moon and all her stars I shall dash out two of thy front teeth with my truncheon: sing! else I shall cut the

#40#

fingers from thy right hand, and mar thy minstrelsy for ever. Did not thy traitor King Bruce cause the Carmelite bard of Edward to sing of his fight at the brook of Bannock. Sing! else I shall strip thy minstrel mantle from thy back, and scourge thee over the border."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Lord Dacre! this language is somewhat too rough," <M>thus interposed Lord Surrey</M>; "the spirit of the poet should be soothed by kind words, and kindled by commendations. Thinkest thou that a minstrel can be urged into inspiration, as thou urgest on thy fiery warriors? His sensitive spirit must, like a tender wound, be touched softly. Under your darkening brow and threatning eye a poet would have a hero’s soul, and a hero’s hand, if he sung one verse that deserved to live. Can the lark sing under the wing of the raven?"</DiaM>

Sir James spoke in a tone modest but unembarrassed: <Dia>"The duty of a minstrel, my Lord Surrey, is to sing a strain pleasant to the listener’s ear, and what other song could the poet sing, who spoke truth of the noble Howard. But were I to sing how Lord Dacre escaped, and hardly escaped, from the war-axe of the Douglas; or how he shunned the encounter of the King of Scotland’s lance, who would protect me from his wrath? and yet his wrath should not stay my song, did I not feel that the funeral wail becomes me more than a chaunt

#41#

such as would please the victor."</Dia> <DiaM>"By the soul of my ancestors," <M>replied Lord Dacre,</M> "thou art a bold bard, and I’ll warrant me thy hand is as dextrous with the lance as with the harp. I beg to be counted thy friend; thou hast a fair advantage over me; to be stricken both with sword and song, is not the wish of Thomas Dacre, so sing or be silent, as thou wilt."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Spoken like thyself, my iron veteran," <M>said Lord Surrey</M>; "in the Howards’ tent the poet is as free as if that seat where he sits were one of his pastoral hills, and the banner above it the eagle of his native rock!"</DiaM>

Sir James sat and mused for a minute’s space, and then, with a manly voice, sung a song which was long remembered about the pastoral vailles of the border. Lord Howard leaned over his sword, and the knights crowded round the tent to listen to the strain.

<QuotedText>THE SONG OF SIR JAMES.
I.
The grass of Flodden’s ruby red, That late so greenly grew;
The sweet lark’s foot is wet with blood
Instead of silver dew.
For Howard’s arrow-flight has flown, And in their fleet career
His steeds have trod o’er Scotland’s strength, And broke her deadly spear.

#42#

II.
I sing, and while I sing I sigh!
For had these gallant men,
Whose life's-blood stains the river red,
Whose bodies choke the glen,
Been sagely ruled, as bravely led,
Yon moon above us hung,
Another sight had seen, and I
A happier song had sung.

III.
The sword has smote, the shaft is flown,
The victor's cry is cry’d;

More sad is he who basely lives,
Than he who bravely died.
I’d rather lie like Lindsay sped,
Have Douglas’ bloody brow;
Or share stout Maxwell’s grassy bed,
Than be as I am now.

IV.
I fought where Surrey’s shafts flew thick,
Where rose fierce Selby’s cry;
Where Dacre rush’d, and Stanley charg’d, 
And yet I could not die.
Farewell to Scotland’s pleasant land,
And to its lovely dames!
To lordly lance, and knightly brand,
So sings he, sad Sir James.</QuotedText>

Lord Surrey held out his hand; <Dia>“There minstrel! there is the right hand of a Howard, and it is as

#43#

proud of the poet’s clasp as of the touch of a monarch. Thou hast sung wisely and well, and though an enemy, and English blood on thy hands, ask what boon thou wilt, and it is thine. May his reptile memory be embalmed in scornful verse, like a spider in amber, who honours not the unteachable and untaught art."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Thanks, noble Howard," <M>answered Sir James,</M> "but I have no boon to beg. I came to thy tent door to dare thee to mortal strife; I have seen thee, I have heard thee, and I fear thy nobleness of nature more than I fear thy sword."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"By Saint Edward!" <M>said Lord Surrey,</M> "thou art a bold bard. I can touch a harp, fashion a verse, and with a sword do my devoir as a knight. Minstrel! it might do thee some harm to strike three strokes of a sword with me underneath the moon; so I do not advise thee. I honour thy skill in the art of heaven too much to lead thee into the mystery of an art which men scruple not to say comes from another place."</DiaM> <DiaM>"It is unlike the Howard," <M>answered Sir James,</M> "to bring down the noble profession of arms to the level of an art practised by strolling mendicants. Let the minstrel sing his hireling song, and get his food and his dress, of which he is unworthy; but never compare the chaunt of a metre-ballad maker to the sound of the trumpet, the rushing to battle, and the splintering of

#44#

the spears, in the presence of lords and beauteous dames."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"By my faith! and this wandering poet says well," <M>said Lord Stanley,</M> "and I shall never hear a song sung but I shall think of its unworthiness. It is an idle trade, a fashion which has sprung up lately at court. In the palace of his defunct Majesty of Scotland were harpers rude, and poets plenty; and the chivalrous monarch himself could touch the harp, and labour out a verse. Nay, even the son of grim old Douglas has thrown helmet and spear aside, and his verses have come further south than ever came his ancestor’s sword. But what have we here? Ned Clifford and my woodsman, John of Bredislee, bearing a slaughtered body?"</DiaM> Lord Dacre exclaimed, <DiaQ>"By heaven! the King of Scotland!"</DiaQ> All rose, and a warrior’s body bathed in blood and pierced with wounds was laid on the floor of the tent.

The warrior’s form was worthy of a king, and was found in a place that well became a warrior. He was finely formed and firmly knit; with a nose slightly aquiline, a broad and noble brow shaded with close black curls, and arms long, round, and sinewy, one of which still held a shivered sword, and the other grasped a broken spear, which had pierced the steel mail, flowered in gold, that covered his bosom. His helmet was dinted with

#45#

blows from sword and bill, and the points of arrows had etched the glossy polish. He was found amid a crowd of knights and soldiers, where the banner of Scotland was displayed; but his surcoat was gone, and the flag had been cut from the staff. He was the last that had fallen; the ground around was slippery with blood, and covered with cloven helmets.

Lord Surrey looked long and anxiously upon the noble figure before him; his colour changed; his eye glistened; he turned aside and said, <DiaQ>"Ah! gallant King of Scotland, little wist I when the challenge to battle passed this morning between us, and thou saidst to my herald, that to no knight in Christendom wouldst thou sooner give a free field and choice of time, than to the Howard! little did I think that ere the midnight moon shone, thou wouldst lie in my tent pierced through with wounds, and that noble and fiery spirit quenched for ever."</DiaQ> And, taking a velvet cloak sparkling with gold and gems, he laid it softly over the body, and said, <DiaQ>let prayers be in our tent, and let my four knights, Gray, Benson, Bulmer, and Selby, sit up with the slaughtered prince."</DiaQ>

Sir James sat silent; his brow was dark, and in his eye there sparkled a light which seemed to fluctuate between gravity and mirth; but when he heard the words of Lord Howard, his face grew

#46#

flushed, tears trembled under his long dark eyelashes, and he exclaimed, in a voice that made the boldest start, <DiaQ>"Howard! Howard! such honours are misplaced. That is the body of a man of low degree; worthy indeed, for valour is worthiness, of being watched honourably, and interred with respect, but unworthy from his rank of such honours as thou art paying."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Friend minstrel," <M>said Lord Stanley,</M> "thou art strangely bold, and were it not that the noble Howard esteems an art in which he himself excels, thou mightest feel my rebuke in another way than words. Outwardly, in form and face, that is James Stuart; what mark is wanting to prevent conviction?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"That mark is wanting, Lord Stanley," said Sir James, "which was worn in memory of a more terrible field than that of Flodden. That fatal symbol of filial disobedience, of the rebellion of son against father, the penance chain of iron which James Stuart has worn next his body since the field of Sauchieburn, is on another body, dead or living."</DiaM>

All stood anxiously round, as one of the knights unbraced the armour, and displayed the body. No chain was there, and Lord Surrey said, <DiaQ>"let my cloak remain as a covering, for he was a worthy knight."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"Please you, my Lord Surrey," <M>said his confessor,</M> "this may be the monarch’s body yet. I

#47#

know somewhat of penances, and how they are observed; and I know no gay and gallant knight who would freeze his bare body with a weight of cold iron, who could escape from it by an indulgence from good mother church."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Thank thee for that, priest," <M>said Lord Dacre,</M> "the indulgence of our mother church gives a seasonable relief to many an opulent transgressor; and when I believe in her powers of remission of sins, I shall compound, and go to Paradise too."</DiaM>

The body was then removed into another tent; four knights in complete armour watched at the head and feet, and seven large torches placed all around threw a gross and wavering gleam of light from side to side of the narrow vale. Sir James saw the body moved away, the knights following, and the torches kindled, and his face glowed with the bitterness of his feelings. He thought on the gallant army, and on the flower of the nobility of Scotland; <FID><Metaphor>there they lay as thick as sheaves in an autumn field: as leaves on a winters’ morn; as grass before the blade of the mower, when he is weary at eve.</Metaphor></FID> Life, as he thus meditated, grew a bitter boon, and death seemed sweet and desirable, since it promised repose and oblivion. <DiaM>"Sir Michael," <M>he whispered to his companion,</M> "the life which I now cast away was unwillingly preserved on that bloody field. Stay me not with

#48#

thy sorcery or thy love, and I shall die as becomes me, and as I deserve."</DiaM> As he spoke he stood in the middle of the tent, drew his sword half way from the sheath, and exclaimed: <DiaQ>"Look on me, Howard, I am James of Scotland; behold my signet ring; and look at my sword: hast thou noble or knight who dares measure a weapon with me? My body thou shalt have, but not till life is gone."</DiaQ> And he drew his sword, struck with the hilt on his bosom, and the links of a chain gave a slight rattle.

The English nobles looked on him, and then broke out into wild laughter. <DiaM>"A poet, a poet," <M>cried Lord Stanley</M>; "he has all the madness necessary for inspiration. Thou, James Stuart, the Poet King? a wandering mendicant — a peasant harper — not one in all our camp would measure swords with such a moon-struck enthusiast as thou."</DiaM> <DiaM>"Here Rawstone, and Hewett," <M>said Lord Dacre</M>, "cool this hot-headed harper in the Twisel. A king! aye, a monarch among mendicants!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Sir Minstrel," <M>said Lord Surrey,</M> "thou art not mad; for no madman could have framed the song thou hast lately sung. Nor can I believe thee knavish, since the divine art is never coupled with an unworthy nature. Nor can I believe thee overcome with wine, for a sober spirit has hitherto conducted thee. Be silent therefore, or begone: or if thou needs must speak, let thy words be those of

#49#

my favourite art, even though thou shouldst sing in the homely language of thine own people."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Lord Surrey," <M>said Sir James,</M> “behold these true tokens—the signet-ring, and the chain."</DiaM> He unbuckled his armour, bared his bosom, and Howard looked to where he motioned him; a slight flush of anger passed over his face as he said, <DiaQ>"Sir Minstrel, this is not well: the chain of the King is of iron; thine is of solid gold. The chain of the monarch is heavy, and thine is as light as that which a maiden hangs round her neck when she becomes a bride. Go from me now; but, as thou seem est of a mirthful mood, come to Raby-tower, and, by the faith of verse and the joy of the harp-string, I shall let thee be as mad and merry as thou wilt; but there is time and place for all things."</DiaQ>

Sir James knew not what to say: he glanced to his companion, and there sat Sir Michael, as silent and still as a statue. He looked at the nobles and knights, and saw mirth in every face. He snatched up a basnet of steel, and gazing at the form which its polish reflected back, he muttered an imprecation, dashed the basnet on the floor, and striking it with his sword as it rolled, clave the solid steel cleanly asunder, and the fragments flew to the opposite extremities of the tent. <DiaM>"By St. George, poet," <M>said Lord Stanley, laying the cloven basnet together,</M> "if thy harp-string had the sorcery of

#50#

thy sword, thou wouldst soon harp me out of a fair estate. Let me look on the blade — ah! by Saint Edward, this is a royal sword. I saw it in fair Holyrood, honoured as a relic of that bold rebel King Robert. Minstrel, I must make free to keep this weapon, and arrest thy person."</DiaM>

Sir James started back from the grasp of Lord Stanley, and presenting the point of his weapon, exclaimed: <DiaQ>"He who wishes to wear it, must win it."</DiaQ> The sword of Lord Stanley was bared in a moment, and they advanced on each other. Lord Surrey snatched a mantle from the arm of one of his knights, threw it over the points of the swords, and rushing between them, said, <DiaQ>"For shame, Lord Stanley, to draw a sword in my tent on a guest whom I love to honour for his skill in the art which wise men admire."</DiaQ> <DiaM>"’Tis James Stuart himself, by heaven," <M>exclaimed Lord Dacre,</M> "this quarrel has made him into a monarch; or else he has the art of transmigration as well as of minstrelsy."</DiaM> <DiaM>"It is the King of Scotland, and no one else," <M>shouted <ChNoNameMinor>a soldier,</ChNoNameMinor> from the entrance of the tent</M>; "slay him where he stands, for he slew my two brethren."</DiaM> Swords were drawn in haste —- a rush of knights filled the tent — the lights were extinguished, blows and thrusts were given, and blood spilt. The tumult subsided — the torches were rekindled, and the voice of Lord Surrey was

#51#

heard, saying, <DiaQ>"Where is the King of Scotland?"</DiaQ> <DiaM>"He has slain Lord Dacre outright," <M>said <ChNoNameMinor>a knight</ChNoNameMinor> in a low voice — his men are bearing him to his tent.</M></DiaM> <DiaM>"Peace be with him; he was a bold and forward soldier," <M>answered Lord Surrey</M>; "but who has taken the King of Scots? He has stricken Lord Stanley through the body. He is now bleeding to death, his knights kneeling over him, and James Stuart is gone like a passing shadow — like a breath of evil wind that goes unseen, and leaves death and destruction behind."</DiaM></SceneDia>
