THE Bishop of <Cryptonym>---</Cryptonym> had many peculiarities, but they all leaned to the side of virtue; and as he was the grandfather of <AuthorI>my heroine, I</AuthorI> shall give <Reader>the reader</Reader> a short insight into his character, by relating some part of his history.

Early in life, he had the misfortune to lose the lovely partner of his joys and sorrows, who died in giving birth to a son, her first child. The Bishop, who was at that time only in rank a Doctor of Divinity, though he supported himself as a christian, still felt as a man; and proved his respect for her memory by devoting himself to the education of his son, who grew up to be a youth of very promising genius and ability.

When Henry Laviton (for that was the Bishop's name) had attained his tenth year, a friend of his father's died, bequeathing to the Doctor an only daughter, with a fortune of twenty thousand pounds, requesting him to superintend her education, and, if she had no objection, at the age of twenty-one, give her to his son.

Doctor Laviton endeavoured to comply with the wishes of Mr. Middlehaven, for so was the father of Glaphyra called; <SpeechInsert>"But," <M>said he, arguing this point with his friend</M>, "I cannot think of laying any restraint on the young people; if they prefer one another, and I will strive to make them amiable, they shall be united, not else. I hate a marriage of compulsion. A thousand circumstances, you know, may happen to make the most prosperous alliance turn out contrary to our expectations; affection alone can in such a situation make the heart amends for the evils of fortune; the very property of your daughter might perhaps tempt a young man who has his fortune to make; I shall therefore conceal that from the knowledge of Henry, and indeed from her own; the idea of wealth might make her vain and conceited, while it could be of no real advantage."</SpeechInsert>

After the death of Mr. Middlehaven, the Doctor began to form a plan for the education of his ward; and having consulted his sister, Miss Martha Laviton, on the domestic parts of it, he himself undertook her instruction in every branch of necessary learning; indeed he went several steps further; and as he designed his son for the study of divinity, he determined to give Glaphyra such a general knowledge of the classics as should enable her to interest herself in the studies of Henry, and render her a companion, whose society would at all times be satisfactory and delightful, while the same degree of information would, he hoped, prevent her from having recourse to those trifling and insignificant pursuits too often followed by the female sex. <MonologueThought>"Yet," <M>said he, mentally</M>, "I must be cautious, that in avoiding Scylla I do not strike upon Charybdis, and make the girl a coxcomical pedantic woman, which is of all human beings the most unamiable."</MonologueThought>

Glaphyra Middlehaven had not been in the habitation of the Doctor three months, ere she quite transformed it -— her extreme vivacity weaned the Doctor from the melancholy which the starchness and reserve of his sister, Miss Martha Laviton, had contributed to encourage -— it gave life and animation to Henry, who now first began to throw off the great diffidence which the formality of his aunt had created; he had now a companion, to whom he could relate his successes in his juvenile sports; he had also a companion in his studies, and neither Phædrus or Ovid appeared half so tedious, since Glaphyra had learned them with him. But Glaphyra rested not here -— she threw away her doll -— she broke all her cups and saucers, to be at a hoop or a top -— she would ride round the lawn on the Doctor's favourite horse, without saddle or bridle -— nay, she even mounted the apple and pear trees, to dislodge the ripe fruit from their heavy laden branches. Miss Laviton constantly complained that Glaphyra was a perfect Tomboy, that she tore her cloaths, scratched her hands and face, and was never fit to be seen. To these sagacious remarks the Doctor generally replied -- <SpeechHabitual>"All in good time, we must not expect old heads upon young shoulders; it is better to pay the shoemaker than the apothecary,"</SpeechHabitual> or by some such common-place answer, which never failed to move the anger of Miss Laviton, who concluded -— <SpeechHabitual>"Well, this is the consequence of going out of the beaten path, and teaching girls Greek and Latin."</SpeechHabitual>

The youthful Henry having finished the part of his education he was designed to learn at home, was sent from thence to the university, where he kept up a regular correspondence with Glaphyra, whose time during his absence was employed in learning the domestic duties of the mistress of a family, in acquiring those ornamental accomplishments which suited her rank and fortune, and in perfecting herself in the knowledge of French and the dead languages; but so well had Doctor Laviton guarded her from the little vanity of priding herself upon her attainments, by the real humility of a religious education, that she was at once the most artless and unaffected of women; and while she rejoiced in the goodness of that Being who had blessed her beyond the common lot, she neither despised nor neglected those who had been less fortunate.

Henry had been ordained to the clerical function three months, when Doctor Laviton was, without the smallest application on his own part, created Bishop of ---; and he was at the same time given to understand, that his son might, if he pleased, be presented to the living which his preferment of course obliged him to resign.

<SceneFragment>Henry was informed of his good fortune, and informed at the same time, that as his father would immediately remove to his bishoprick, he must enter into instant possession of the living and house at Greenham, (so was the residence of the Doctor called) and that Glaphyra would accompany the Doctor and Miss Martha to <Cryptonym>---</Cryptonym>.

Henry looked at Glaphyra, Glaphyra looked on the carpet, and Doctor Laviton left them together.

<DiaM>"This house will appear to me worse than a desert," <M>said Henry, after a silence of some moments</M>; "I do not think I can possibly live in it when you are all gone."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I cannot suppose the grandeur of a palace will make us any amends for your loss, Henry," <M>replied Glaphyra</M>; "I shall want you to walk with me, to talk with me, to praise the puddings and pies I have made, and to make my sewing go off lighter with the sound of your voice."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I think, Glaphyra," <M>answered Henry, taking her hand, and looking tenderly in her face</M>, "and I have often thought so lately, that though I love my father and my aunt, I should feel their loss less than yours."</DiaM>

Glaphyra blushed; she took up her work, and affected to be extremely busy; then she turned from him, and looked out of the window.

Henry followed her; and putting one arm round her waist, he said, <DiaQ>"If, Glaphyra, you could be happy to be a poor parson's wife, ——</DiaQ>

Glaphyra replied not, but her confusion spoke to the heart of Henry; and having clasped her in his arms, and impressed on her cheek the kiss of faithful affection, he rushed out of the room.</SceneFragment>

<SceneFragment>Doctor Laviton had foreseen the event of his absence; he had long remarked the understanding which appeared between the young people; it was a silent agreement; and though neither had spoken before this period, their looks had left language little to utter.

<DiaM>"What brings you here, Henry?" <M>said the Doctor, as his son entered the study</M>; "I never saw you look so sheepish in my life; if I am not mistaken, you are come a-begging for a wife."</DiaM>

<Dia>"And if I am not mistaken, you have determined, my dear father, that I shall not beg in vain."</Dia>

<Dia>"Go, get you back to Glaphyra, and tell her that I thought she knew better the value of twenty thousand pounds than thus to throw it away."</Dia></SceneFragment>

<ChapEpigraph>"'Gainst self-slaughter there is a prohibition so divine."</ChapEpigraph>

GLAPHYRA, then, the heroine of <Book>these memoirs</Book>, was the fruit of this marriage; and as nothing very material happened during her infancy, <AuthorI>I shall pass</AuthorI> over that period, simply remarking, that the Bishop was, in its lapse, gathered to his forefathers; while his sister, Miss Martha Laviton, having been sheltered a few years in the bosoms of her nephew and niece, gradually sunk into decay, and was interred near him.

Glaphyra, at the age of nineteen, was the admiration of the small circle in which she moved; her form possessed the lightness of elegance, her face the beauty of expression, her eye darted intelligence, and her varying colour revealed every emotion of her soul; her understanding was excellent; her genius quick, lively, and refined; her education liberal and extensive: the hearts of her parents were wrapped up in her society; she was the delight and ornament of their age and they blessed the goodness of that Being who had given her to them.

The religion of Glaphyra was that of principle; it was the calm, rational devotion of a being sensibly convinced of the finiteness of human understanding; it was the humble confidence of hope looking up to the fruition of faith, and ever acting on the conviction of accountableness; it was the ardent piety of a christian, firmly convinced of the insufficiency of the best efforts of fragile man: and the reader will see how it stood the test of sickness, sorrow, and misfortune.

There dwelt in the neighbourhood of Greenham a young man of the name of Heartly; he was the officiating minister of the adjacent parish, and frequently honoured Mr. Laviton with his visits.

Heartly was a man whose character soon gained the esteem and confidence of Mr. and Mrs. Laviton; he was a being who to be loved, needed only to have been known; and so greatly did these excellent parents admire and respect him, that Mr. Laviton would often say to his wife -— <SpeechHabitual>"I only wish this young man and our Glaphyra would take a fancy to each other; I should not mind whether he were rich or poor, but I would give my child to him in the firm confidence of his virtue."</SpeechHabitual>

The frequency of Heartly's visits to Greenham rectory soon became the talk of the neighbourhood; while his delicate and well-directed attentions, the assiduity with which he followed the steps of Glaphyra, the eagerness with which he anticipated her wishes, and the delight Glaphyra appeared to take in his society, all conspired to give these fond parents hopes of speedily beholding the accomplishment of their wishes.

<Exclamation>But how vain are the wishes of mortals, and how shortsighted are the very wisest of men!</Exclamation> Heartly suddenly quitted that part of the country, without assigning any reason for his absence, or without giving any one the slightest clue wherewith to guide the vast labyrinth of conjecture.

Glaphyra was at first melancholy, then pensive; and after a short period she resumed her wonted serenity.

It was once reported that Heartly was seen in London, then that he had gone with a lady to Naples, then that he was dead; but nothing certain transpired respecting him. The parents of Glaphyra often wondered, and talked those matters over to themselves; they could not believe that Heartly was insensible to the merits of Glaphyra, but they carefully refrained from talking of him before her; and while they regretted the loss of his society, and the disappointment of their own wishes, they rejoiced to find that he had quitted Glaphyra before his merits had made a lasting impression on the sensibility of her heart.

A few months after this period, the charms of <AuthorWe>our heroine</AuthorWe> touched the heart of a young nobleman, no less distinguished by his personal merits than his rank and situation.

Lord Frederic Feeverly was the second son of an English peer; he was handsome, elegant, and accomplished, learned, liberal, and virtuous.

The parents of Glaphyra received his visits at first with mistrust; they liked not unequal alliances; they would rather have seen their beloved child the contented wife of a plain country gentleman, more humble, and perhaps more happy; but when they had been some time conversant with Lord Frederic, they insensibly lost every wish which militated against him, and felt that in consigning their daughter to his arms, they should be quite happy.

The father of Lord Frederic was at this time absent from Great Britain on a foreign embassy; but little doubting of his concurrence, particularly as after the demise of her parents she would possess at least thirty thousand pounds, his Lordship prosecuted his suit with vigour, and flattered himself success was about to crown his wishes.

Glaphyra received him with affability, and expressed no repugnance to his assiduities; and the world prophesied that Glaphyra was about to become a Lady. 

Lord Frederic, amid all his virtues, possessed one failing, which at times overclouded and destroyed them -- his impetuosity of temper; his passionate and frenzical extravagance, when any darling project was destroyed, was almost untameable; and while he was convinced of his own errors, while he often, after the effervescence of passion had subsided, repented and sorrowed for his own intemperate heat, he had not a sufficient degree of resolution to correct and subdue it.

Now it so happened, that after he had visited our heroine for four months, after her heart had begun to declare in his favour, and after he had yielded himself up to the delusive impressions of hope, that the long-expected answer to his letter, which had informed his father of his attachment, arrived; but it was far from containing the satisfactory acquiescence in his wishes which Lord Frederic had expected; on the contrary, it informed him that his father had other views, and commanded him immediately to quit Greenham and join his family.

The Earl of Fielding also wrote to the father of Glaphyra, informing him it was impossible he could consent to this alliance, and that he must ever consider the reception Mr. Laviton had given his son as a blameable attempt to involve him in an unequal alliance.

<SceneQuasi>The spirit of Laviton, in spite of Christian charity, revolted from any further connection with Lord Frederic's family; and trusting to the conduct, the filial piety, and good sense of his daughter, he immediately went to her apartment with the open letter in his hand, and placing it before her, he said -— <DiaQ>"Glaphyra, act for yourself: fully convinced of your competency to act for yourself, your mother and father resign their honour and its vindication to you."</DiaQ>

Glaphyra took the open letter from him, and began to peruse its contents; but its language, while it wounded her feelings and her pride, also melted her into tears; for it convinced her that she had but one way to conduct herself -— that she must resign Lord Frederic for ever.</SceneQuasi> In the bitterness of disappointment, she began to lament her own hapless destiny, and to imagine that she herself was the most miserable of human beings. At one moment she resolved to see Lord Frederic no more; and then again to send immediately for him, to unite her fate with his, and to despise every obstacle: the manly, elegant form of her lover presented itself to her minds eye, arrayed in the fascinating garb of affection and entreaty; the thoughts of his sorrow, of his regret, were almost too much to support, and in an agony of tears she wept for many hours: but as her agitation subsided -— as she remembered the stigma cast on her affectionate parents -— as she retraced her own descent, which she felt to be such as would reflect no disgrace on the family of her lover -— as she recollected the probable inheritance she would have brought to him, and the contumelious treatment she had received, she was clearly convinced, that propriety, prudence, and duty, left her no alternative; and, particularly as her parents had so implicitly confided to her conduct, she determined, whatever might be her own feelings, to see Lord Frederic no more. <SceneQuasi>Having sent for her mother, she informed her, with tears of anguish, of her resolution, and requested that her father would put an immediate end to the visits of Lord Frederic. <DiaM>"I cannot," <M>cried she</M>, "my dear mother," <M>and she sobbed convulsively</M>, "see Lord Frederic again; I shall not be proof against his tears and his entreaties; Oh! his tenderness will deprive me of all my resolution in a moment; I cannot, I must not see him again."</DiaM>

Mrs. Laviton acquiesced in the wishes of her child;</SceneQuasi> <SceneQuasi><Graft>and having kissed</Graft> and embraced her, left her to go with the triumphant information to her husband. <DiaM>"Where, Henry," <M>cried she, while tears of maternal solicitude filled her eyes</M>, "is there a child like our Glaphyra? so forgetful of self, so dutiful, so obedient, so prudent? yes, the prudence of our Glaphyra has nothing ostentatious in it; it is neither formal nor prudish. Heaven shield our darling!"</DiaM>

Mr. Laviton re-echoed this prayer; and then began the arduous task assigned him, namely, that of writing to Lord Frederic, and informing him of Glaphyra's resolution, which he did in the following words:

<QuotedText>"MY LORD,
"I am grieved to be necessitated to give you pain; but the sooner you are informed of Glaphyra's resolution, the better. In consequence of a letter received from the Earl of Fielding, (on which, in respect to your Lordship, I forbear to comment) she declines receiving your future visits; at the same time she bids me inform you, that she shall always esteem the preference you have honoured her with as one of the most gratifying moments of her life. She could not have failed in time to become sensible of your worth, and she regrets, with her parents, the necessity she now feels of bidding you adieu; she joins in best wishes with your Lordship's sincere and disinterested friend,
HENRY LAVITON."</QuotedText></SceneQuasi>

<SceneAction>This letter had not been sent half an hour ere Glaphyra was startled from a painful reverie, by the sound of a horse galloping violently up to the door; and fearfully looking from her window, she beheld Lord Frederic himself; he appeared heated with violent exercise; and throwing the bridle of his horse carelessly over the railing which fronted the window, he rushed into the house: she heard him ask for her father; she heard his voice raised in a tone of resentment; she heard him walkabout the room, and her father vainly endeavouring to pacify him; she was near fainting, still the voice of Lord Frederic sounded in her ears, as he frequently pronounced her name; and at length her mother entered her apartment, saying -— <DiaQ>"My dear Glaphyra, this impetuous young man will not be denied; he will take no refusal but from your own lips; you must exert all your fortitude, my Glaphyra, in the cause of duty."</DiaQ>

Glaphyra rose from her seat, she threw her arms round her mother, and wept in her bosom; <DiaM>"Fear not the fortitude of your Glaphyra," <M>said she</M>; "my resolution shall not be shaken; and yet, my dear mother, it is a sad thing to feel one's self obliged to wound the bosom of affection; yes, my own sufferings cannot be less than those of Lord Frederic, for I do love and esteem him most tenderly; nay, I would die to render him happy."</DiaM> Glaphyra sobbed aloud.

<DiaM>"Compose your agitation, my heart's darling," <M>repeated Mrs. Laviton</M>, "and be firm; the path of duty, though strewed with thorns, is alone the path of happiness. My Glaphyra will soon recover her serenity. Compose yourself, and give Lord Frederic an example."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes," <M>cried Glaphyra, rising, and assuming an air of fortitude</M>, "I will set him the example; I will prove to the Earl, his father, that I was not unworthy of him; I will deserve my own self-esteem; and convince my parents, that my first wish is to act rightly, and secure their affection."</DiaM> She then gave her hand to her mother, and they descended the stairs together: Lord Frederic met them at the door of the parlour. <DiaM>"They tell me, Glaphyra," <M>exclaimed he, clasping her hand</M>, "they tell me that you reject my addresses; they tell me that, notwithstanding all that has passed between us, you have determined to cast me off; and that my father, my cruel father, is the cause of this resolution."</DiaM>

Glaphyra tried in vain to speak, and he went on -— <Dia>"Glaphyra! Glaphyra! never can I live without you; my heart, my soul, my mind is wrapt up in your image; for mercy's sake, do not drive me to despair; if you have a heart, let it not be deaf to my remonstrances."</Dia>

Our heroine now recovered, in some measure, her self-possession. <DiaM>"Lord Frederic Feverly," <M>cried she,</M> "hear me a few moments patiently. Is it my happiness, my felicity you seek? or is it the selfish gratification of a passion founded on caprice, which will decay with the youth which first attracted its attention?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"I had flattered myself, Glaphyra, that my wishes were not incompatible with your happiness; I had hoped, that you were convinced that my affection was permanent and sincere. O! you do not, you cannot doubt it, are convinced of it; do not, then, drive me to desperation."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I will never, Lord Frederic, deceive you; I esteem, I respect, I admire you; I had prepared my heart," <M>and her voice softened as she pronounced the words</M>, "to love you: but I had then no idea that I should have been rejected by your family."</DiaM>

<Dia>"They do not know you, or all their objections would vanish. Do not rashly condemn me to misery, for the offence of another."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I will never," <M>said Glaphyra, solemnly</M>, "enter into a family who have rejected me and insulted my parents. Look on me as a sister, as one tenderly interested in your happiness, as one," <M>and she burst into tears</M>, "who feels every pang you sustain, nay, one who would die to render you happy."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And if these are really your sentiments," <M>exclaimed he, tenderly</M>, "if indeed you lose me, if you feel a wish to render me happy, why should parental tyranny separate us? I am rich enough, my love; rich in your smiles, which alone will compensate for those of every other human being."</DiaM>

Glaphyra withdrew her hand. <Dia>"I must hear no more; Lord Frederic, I must hear no more. I am now come to see you for the last time, to assure you that I shall ever remember your preference with gratitude; but while circumstances remain in their present state, to inform you that we must meet no more. I acquit you of all obligation, and earnestly pray that you may soon recover your wonted ease and serenity."</Dia> She now moved towards the door; but Lord Frederic stood before it, and, in an agitation which almost precluded the power of utterance, he vehemently declared that she should not leave him.

Mr. Laviton attempted to interpose in favour of his daughter; when Lord Frederic, pulling a pistol from his pocket, and still standing with his back to the door, swore, that unless she promised to become his wife, he would instantly destroy himself. Glaphyra fainted, Lord Frederic rushed forward, and Mr. Laviton fortunately succeeded in wresting the weapon from his grasp. <DiaM>"For shame, my Lord," <M>cried he</M>, "for shame, you are unworthy of her; you have now indeed lost my child for ever; never shall she unite herself with a wretch who has dared to meditate self-destruction; no, I would rather follow my darling to the grave than bestow her on a suicide, a wretch who dares lift his sacrilegious arm against his Maker."</DiaM>

Lord Frederic, awed by this reproof, became instantly calm; he acknowledged the justice of Mr. Laviton's anger; and having in vain intreated to be heard, and as vainly requested to see Glaphyra once more, he departed, overwhelmed with anguish and self-reproach.</SceneAction>

Glaphyra at length recovered her senses; but the image of Lord Frederic attempting his own life still presented itself to her view; and nothing but her father's promise of going himself to the residence of Lord Frederic could even for a moment calm her agitation.

Mr. Laviton, whose alarm and anxiety was almost as great as his daughter's, went instantly in pursuit of his Lordship, and heard, to his great satisfaction, that he had, immediately on his return from Greenham, set off for London, leaving a note behind him to the following effect:

<QuotedText>"Be not alarmed for my safety; I will no more risk an existence which I may one day hope will be valuable to my Glaphyra. I will fly to my cruel father, and implore his pity; till then, farewell.
F. FEVERLY."</QuotedText>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. III.</ChapMarker>

<ChapEpigraph>"O! if a virgin, and your affection not gone forth."</ChapEpigraph>

Mr. Laviton concealed the hopes of Lord Frederic from his daughter; and though she ceased to think of him as a lover, still felt the tenderest interest in his happiness; she felt a vacuum in her bosom, which no society could fill; she regretted his many amiable qualities; and though she blamed the passionate rashness of his conduct, she still felt (why should I conceal it?), in the romanticity of his attachment, a thousand charms, which increased her feeling and her regret; his extravagance was enthusiastic, and while it added to her tenderness for him, it softened her sorrow into a kind of pleasing melancholy, which leaves the mind sad, but does not make it unhappy.

To erase from the thoughts of his Glaphyra every unpleasant recollection, Mn Laviton first endeavoured to arm her mind with fortitude, and having so done, he let the effervescence of sorrow have vent, and then trusted to time to meliorate and restore her gaiety and serenity: but at the end of many months, still finding her abstracted and unhappy, he determined to take her an excursion, which might wean her from this darling sorrow, by diverting her mind from the contemplation of past circumstances. The greater part of two years were spent in travel: Glaphyra recovered her serenity, her vivacity once more returned, she retraced the incidents of her past life, she remembered her last interview with Lord Frederic, and though a lingering partiality still made her cherish his memory with a more than sisterly affection, though she could not forget his enthusiastic and generous attachment, and still sighed when she remembered that they had probably met for the last time, yet reason, when permitted to plead, acknowledged that she could have had little prospect of happiness with a man of his violent and ungovernable temper, a man who had dared to meditate self-destruction.

An accidental cold, caught by attending a sick neighbour in the dead of night during a severe frost, soon after their return to Greenham, afflicted Mr. Laviton; and as it was accompanied with several alarming symptoms, his medical attendants recommended him to visit Clifton: as soon, therefore, as his convenience would admit, he set out, attended by his wife and daughter; and hiring a ready-furnished house in Richmond-place, that he might breathe the pure air of the country, and at the same time profit by the salubrity of the waters, he soon found himself comfortably settled.

<SceneDia>A few days after their arrival a message was brought from their next-door neighbor, informing them, that she would be happy, if agreeable, to wait on them; and with their usual chearfulness, Mr. Laviton and family expressed themselves pleased at her politeness. Lady Lawson, therefore, about an hour after, made her appearance, accompanied by Miss Pollet, her sister, and her son and daughter.

Lady Lawson was a most respectable woman; left a widow at the age of thirty, she had never thought of changing her condition, though frequently importuned and followed by the other sex, in the hope of succeeding; but she had invariably dismissed every pretender with a degree of determined civility, which had in the instant silenced every hope: she was now fifty years of age, agreeable in her person, plain and easy in her manners, mild, gentle, and unassuming in her deportment; her understanding was above mediocrity, yet her easiness of temper had in many instances overpowered her better judgment, particularly in the education of her children, who, inheriting from their father very violent tempers, were at the age of twenty entirely beyond the controul of their mother.

Miss Pollet was a strange compound of folly, vanity, and pride, with a very plain person, and this, gentle reader, at the age of forty-five.

Mr. and Miss Lawson, like half the voting men and women of fashion of the present day, were fond of dressing, dancing, laughing, talking of high play, flirting, riding, racing, and the young gentleman a good proficient even in drawing.

After the first civilities of introduction were over, Miss Lawson sidled up to our heroine, and, in a tone of earnest enquiry, demanded <ReportedSpeechQuotes>"if she went to the ball?"</ReportedSpeechQuotes>

<DiaM>"My mother is unable to accompany me," <M>answered Glaphyra</M>, "or I should like it much; but since my poor father's indisposition, we make it a point that he does not go out; and as he goes to bed at ten o'clock, our return after that hour would perhaps disturb him."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"O Lord!" <M>cried the young lady</M>, "that couldn't hurt him; and, besides, he would not hear it."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have no wish to go," <M>said Glaphyra</M>, "without my mother, and I am sure she could not go."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Well, I envy you your indifference, child; why I should die if I was to be confined two nights together; why t'other day, when I got a cold and was kept at home from the ball, you don't know what a fret I was in; and there was dear sweet Mr. Lessingham, the divinest creature in the world, sent that very evening to ask me for a partner; one would have thought it was done on purpose to mortify me; and Jack told me afterwards that he danced all night with Miss Cealand, a mere milk-and-water doll, and then so stupid, you have no idea."</Dia>

<DiaM>"O Euphemia!" <M>exclaimed her brother</M>, "pray do not say that Cornelia Cealand is not handsome; oh, she is more than painting can express," <M>touching his cheeks with a significant nod</M>: "you, even you, Miss Laviton, have not a more beautiful natural colour than Miss Cealand; her's are not false colours."</DiaM>

Glaphyra blushed, and even Miss Lawson appeared to gain crimson from this remark; which her aunt prevented her from answering, by saying -— <DiaQ>"I cannot see, for my part, any beauty in Miss Cealand, only she happens to be the fashion, because Mr. Lessingham praises her. I verily think if Lessingham was to say that his cook was handsome, and give her fine clothes, every one else would say so too."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Mr. Lessingham is very handsome," <M>said Lady Lawson</M>, "and so is Miss Cealand; she is more, and I only wish he may really take a fancy to her, for I know no young woman who possesses so much merit: yet I do not think that either Lessingham or Miss Cealand have any particular regard for each other."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No," <M>retorted Miss Pollet</M>; "whatever Miss Cealand may have, I am sure Mr. Lessingham has no regard for her."</DiaM>

Mr. Lawson burst into a loud laugh.

<DiaM>"What do you laugh at, Jack?" <M>asked Miss Lawson, angrily</M>; "you are always so simple, you can't hold your tongue a minute. I am very sure, as my aunt Pollet says, that he wont marry Miss Cealand; I am sure he looks higher; besides, I have often heard him protest against girls."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes, Lessingham will not marry a girl," <M>repeated Miss Pollet, smiling and bridling</M>, "he knows better. Did you ever see Miss Cealand asked Euphemia," <M>again addressing our heroine</M>.</DiaM>

Glaphyra replied in the negative.

<DiaM>"O! do go," <M>continued she</M>, "do go with us to-night to the ball, and then you will see her."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"We are not going to-night, sister," <M>said Mr. Lawson</M>, "that I know of; you know mamma said she could not go, and I do not think you will prevail on Emily, she is so very unwell."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh! I'll teaze my sister till I make her go," <M>answered Euphemia</M>; "I know she only pretends to be sick, merely to spite me; and I am determined she shall go."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"We cannot go without a chapron," <M>said her youthful aunt</M>; "and if my niece wont go, we must stay at home."</DiaM>

Again Mr. Lawson laughed, and again his sister bid him be quiet, and hold his nonsensical tongue.

Miss Pollet demanded what he laughed at; and Lady Lawson, covered with confusion at the conduct of her family, now rose to depart, requesting that she might often be favoured with a visit from the Lavitons in the morning, as Mr. Laviton's health would not permit his quitting the house in an afternoon; <DiaM>"and I, on my part, will not stand upon ceremony," <M>said she</M>, "but often drop in and take my tea with you: as to Miss Laviton, she must go into public a little, and I shall expect the honour of being her chapron."</DiaM>

Glaphyra and her mother both expressed their thanks to her for her civility, curtsied to the stiff bend of Miss Pollet, and returned the dip of Miss Lawson, and the familiar bow of her brother, and the family party retired.</SceneDia>

The following day Mr. and Mrs. Laviton, with their daughter, returned this visit; and from that moment a day scarcely passed without their meeting.

The character of Lady Lawson rose daily in the estimation of the whole family; they admired her patience, her mildness, and her moderation; they saw and pitied her anxiety respecting her children; they beheld her hourly forbearance to her sister; her hand was liberally extended to the relief of the necessitous, and her heart was ever open to pity the afflicted.

<SpeechInsert>"The rest of the family can only be tolerated in respect to so excellent a woman," <M>said Mr. Laviton to his wife.</M> "I am sure the contrast between her own children and our Glaphyra cannot fail to strike her; she is indeed to be pitied -— desolate in the midst of a large family, denied the sweet intercourse of kindred minds; ah! how little is her real situation known by the world -— born to an exalted station, possessed of a large fortune, surrounded by family connections, beloved by her dependants, the barbed arrow has still power to reach her; so true it is, that we cannot judge from the external, and so little do exterior circumstances contribute either to our happiness or misery."</SpeechInsert>

<SceneDia>The day of Glaphyra's public appearance at Clifton was settled for the following Tuesday; and, that she might not disturb the repose of her father, she consented to spend the night at Lady Lawson's.

At five o'clock, then, <AuthorI>our heroine</AuthorI> entered the drawing-room of her Ladyship, who was the only person attired for the day. She apologized for the absence of her son and daughter, and then sent to inform her sister that Miss Laviton was come, which soon brought that lady from her toilet.

Arrayed in the extreme of fashion, Miss Pollet made her <i>entré</i>.

Glaphyra looked at her with astonishment.

Her flaxen locks (for which she was un-indebted to nature) were drawn up in a point at the top of her head, with a profusion of combs and bows, every one of which was ornamented with an arrow; beneath these luxuriant tresses projected a thin narrow face, a sharp nose, a long pointed chin, with a pair of little grey eyes, which were continually upon the stretch to gather information; her complexion was sallow; her form thin, spare, and inelegant; and a dress, rather fine than clean or neat, contributed in no small degree to render her person disgusting: yet so little had Miss Pollet studied self-knowledge, that <AuthorWe>we verily believe</AuthorWe>, of all her acquaintance, she was the only person inclined to allow that the sister of Lady Lawson might still be considered handsome, and that what she had lost in youth she had gained in dignity of manners -— an agreeableness in that <i>je ne sçai quoi</i> generally yeleped knowledge of the world. With a kind of studied negligence, she curtsied slightly to our heroine, walked slowly up to a sofa by the fire, and throwing one leg, gracefully, as she thought, over the other, she complained of excessive fatigue -— <DiaM>"These girls are enough to ruin the strongest constitution," <M>exclaimed she</M>; "I am wearied to death, and yet I consider myself as an extremely good walker: Lady Horneck was done up in half the time."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Was my daughter Horneck with you?" <M>asked Lady Lawson, in a tone of anxiety</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"She was," <M>replied Miss Pollet</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Did Sir James know of her going? no, I am sure he did not," <M>repeated Lady Lawson.</M> "I am convinced that Emilia will ruin her health by such a continued round of rioting, morning, noon, and night: the best health could not stand it, and my poor Emilia is as delicate as infancy."</DiaM>

A loud knocking at the street door announced the arrival of the family; and Miss Lawson, in a few minutes, <ArrivalDeparture>entered the room</ArrivalDeparture>, accompanied by a very beautiful woman, whom she instantly introduced to Glaphyra by the name of Miss Clarion.

The person of Miss Clarion was tall, graceful, and commanding; her eyes dark, fierce, and penetrating; she was more striking than fascinating, more admired than loved; she was the first seen in every party, but the eye, often tired of gazing on her, rested on the more humble claims of inferior loveliness; and while she bore away the palm of beauty from most of her competitors, she saw herself without one real pretender.

Born to no inheritance, and passionately fond of attention and admiration, she had long hoped, by a prosperous marriage, to secure the possession of that admiration and attention which would, she well knew, in the wane of her charms, be denied to the indigent Miss Clarion; and feeling no ambition beyond that of shining and being envied, she bent all her arts, all her thoughts, her hopes, and her wishes, to this one point.

Her friend, Miss Lawson, had robbed her of Sir James Horneck, just at the moment when she had expected to have taken him in her toils, which was an affront she had not yet forgiven, though she confined her resentment to her own bosom, contenting herself, whenever opportunity offered, by casting sarcastic reflections on the Baronet and his lady -— the manly, generous anxiety of the one for his lady's health, she insinuated to be jealousy; while she exaggerated the failings and levity of the other into vices the most odious, fixing the dart levelled by her malignity the more securely, by lamenting the unfortunate propensities of her friend, Lady Horneck.

Sir James Horneck was a Baronet of the old school -— preserving the simplicity of the country gentleman, while he united with it the politeness of a courtier; his person was rather prepossessing than handsome, and a general wish to oblige rendered his manners uncommonly engaging; a few years older than his wife, his love for her was excessive, and formed alike the happiness and misery of his existence.

Lady Horneck was loveliness personified; her face beautiful beyond expression; her form delicate in the extreme; the elegant simplicity of her manners added a new charm to her beauty; while the weakness of her constitution, and a certain pallidness of complexion, made every beholder tremble lest this being should be recalled to her native skies: yet Lady Horneck herself possessed no such fear; and though she loved her husband, doted on her child, and honoured her excellent mother, she yielded herself up to the little vanity of dressing to be admired; and was always to be seen in public, notwithstanding that she saw both this husband and parent made unhappy by her conduct.

Mr. Lessingham, who finished the group assembled at Lady Lawson's dinner party, was at this period eight-twenty only; his person more than agreeable, but not handsome; the acute penetration of his hazel eye was sometimes insupportable; while his conversation bespoke at once the gentleman, the scholar, and the man of fashion. 

As Mr. Lessingham was by far the most attractive of the company, in the opinion of Miss Clarion, she no sooner saw him seated, than she contrived to place her chair near him, on pretence of escaping from the air of the window; and, happy in having him so near her, she began to exercise her talent at raillery in roasting him, as she called it, on his affection for Miss Cealand. In vain Mr. Lessingham protested that friendship alone attracted his attentions to the fair Cornelia; Miss Clarion would allow him no quarter, not even when he declared that his heart had never been in such imminent danger as at this moment (and here, <Reader>gentle reader</Reader>, <AuyhorWe>we confess</AuyhorWe> that he stole a side glance at our heroine). <DiaM>"Not love the divine Cornelia!" <M>exclaimed Miss Clarion</M>; "O ye gods! recompense this man for his perfidy!"</DiaM>

Lessingham, in his own defence, retorted the irony upon Miss Clarion, protesting that every other beauty shrunk into littleness at her approach, and gallantly kissing her hand, he repeated, with a theatrical tone -—

<DiaQ>O cruel conqueror! do not trifle here,
Smooth thy sweet brow, and be no more severe,
Thy charms transcendant hide all other charms;
They fill each breast with jealousy's alarms;
They conquer reason and enslave the mind;
Like death, thou mak'st a waste of human kind; 
But Cupid will avenge the lover's pain,
Will bring old age, with wrinkles in his train: 
Forsaken, then, I'm terribly afraid,
My sweet Miss Clarion, you will die a maid.</DiaQ>

Mr. Lawson burst into a loud laugh, which was re-echoed by his sister, <ArrivalDeparture>who at that moment entered the room</ArrivalDeparture>, adorned in the utmost extravagance that whim and fancy could devise. 

Miss Clarion endeavoured to hide her pique by joining in the laugh.

Lady Horneck said -— <DiaQ>"You must allow, Clarion, that you deserved it."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"And so she did," <M>replied Lady Lawson</M>; "she was too hard upon Mr. Lessingham."</DiaM>

Mr. Lawson declared the verses were too good to be lost; <DiaM>"and if it was not for vexing Miss Clarion," <M>cried he</M>, "I would have them put in the papers."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It will not offend me, Mr. Lawson," <M>replied Miss Clarion, angrily</M>; "I assure you I am above minding such nonsense."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Do give it me, then" <M>cried Mr. Lawson</M>; "Lessingham, I must have it."</DiaM>

Mr. Lessingham shook his head; and a servant at the same moment announcing dinner, put an end to the conversation.

Sir James Horneck took the hand of our heroine, and <Blend>led her towards the dining-room</Blend>.

Mr. Lessingham offered his services to Lady Horneck, so that politeness obliged Mr. Lawson to extend the same civility to Miss Clarion; but that lady angrily withdrawing her hand from his grasp, pushed before him, and entered the room alone.

Mr. Lessingham seated himself next to our heroine, who occupied the right hand of Lady Lawson; while Miss Pollet placed herself on the other side of him, and endeavoured as much as possible to attract his attention, but in vain; he answered her questions, returned her civilities, and then immediately turned to the other side, and conversed with our heroine.

Need <AuthorI>I tell</AuthorI> <Reader>my readers</Reader>, that Glaphyra danced with Mr. Lessingham, and that he left her only a few minutes during the whole evening; those few minutes, however, were devoted to Miss Cealand.

<DiaM>"How spitish Miss Cealand looks!" <M>said Miss Lawson to Glaphyra</M>; "why, my dear, if you were a man, you would have twenty duels to fight; every one is in love with your partner."</DiaM>

This was spoken loud enough for Lessingham to hear.

Mr. Lessingham turned from them.

<DiaM>"Indeed," <M>replied Glaphyra</M>, "Mr. Lessingham is very fortunate."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Lessingham," <M>cried Miss Lawson, rapping him on the shoulder with her fan</M>, "you should have heard what I said of you -— you have quite mortified poor Miss Cealand."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Have a little mercy," <M>retorted he</M>; "if once Miss Cealand or I get into your hands, we should be both murdered: remember, Miss Lawson, that though I cannot enter the lists for myself, I must defend a fair lady -— Cornelia Cealand is a lovely girl; I must acknowledge I think her so; but I am sure that if I was to leave off speaking to her for twenty years, it would not vex her."</DiaM>

<Dia>"O you wretch! when you know all the women in Clifton are dying for you."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I am extremely obliged to the ladies," <M>replied Mr. Lessingham</M>, "and to you in particular; for if all the ladies in Clifton entertain a <i>penchant</i> for me, certainly Miss Lawson is included."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Now you are too, too bad; I don't think I will ever speak to you more;" <M>and away ran Miss Lawson to join the dancers</M>.</Dia>

<DiaM>"Come, Miss Laviton," <M>said Lessingham</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I fear I have incurred the anger of too many fair damsels already," <M>said Glaphyra, smiling</M>; "I dare nor monopolize you any longer."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And yet," <M>retorted Lessingham, energetically</M>, "perhaps such a monopoly would be the height of my ambition; but, however, if you wont dance with me, I will sit down with you."</DiaM>

<Dia>"You forget Miss Cealand."</Dia>

<Dia>"I could forget the whole world in your society -— twenty Miss Cealands will not make up one Miss Laviton."</Dia>

<DiaM>"What a flatterer is man!" <M>said Glaphyra, smiling</M>; "and of all men what a flatterer is Mr. Lessingham, when he can say this to the acquaintance of an hour!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I can read your qualifications in your face," <M>replied he, warmly</M>; "do not your eyes beam intelligence? do not your lips utter harmony?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I see I must dance in my own defence," <M>said Glaphyra, rising and joining Lady Horneck, who was standing at the head of the room, and preparing to go down the dance a second time</M>.</DiaM>

Lady Horneck pointed to her partner -— <Dia>"Miss Laviton, a son of Mars, Captain Dashwood."</Dia>

Sir James Horneck approached his lady —- <Dia>"My dear Emily, I wish you would not dance any more; you look quite fagged."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Now that's like a husband," <M>replied she, laughing</M>; "Dashwood, did you ever hear so polite a compliment? Can't you contrive to say something smart? for instance -— your Ladyship looks jaded."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Your Ladyship always looks well," <M>said Dashwood</M>: "Oh, what cruel barbarians are these husbands! I declare this matrimony is a public nuisance."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Come, Lady Horneck," <M>said Sir James, tenderly</M>; "for your own sake, sit down for half an hour; only consider the fatigue you underwent this morning -— you look pale, you appear fatigued."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Well, I will only dance these two more," <M>cried her Ladyship</M>; "and then, like a prudent good housewife, do as you command me."</DiaM>

Sir James sorrowfully returned to his seat, and Lady Horneck again went down the dance; but before she had reached the bottom of the set, she sunk lifeless on the ground.

<DiaM>"O you dear, imprudent creature!" <M>cried Miss Clarion, running to her assistance</M>; "nothing can stop your imprudence."</DiaM>

Sir James, in an agony, flew about the room for smelling-bottles.

Lady Lawson in vain tried to recover her daughter; while Miss Lawson stood at a corner of the room, enjoying the opportunity thus afforded of a flirtation with Captain Dashwood, who she almost acknowledged as captivating as Mr. Lessingham.

Miss Pollet was striving to worm herself into the favour of an old bachelor of the name of Isola, who was just arrived at Clifton, and whose fortune was immense; while Mr. Lawson, who had taken a proper quantity of Madeira during the evening, sat stupidly asleep at the lower end of the room.

Glaphyra, in the mean time, stood by the side of Lady Horneck; and while Lady Lawson and some of the indifferent spectators supported her, she endeavoured to render herself useful by chafing the temples, rubbing the hands, and administering some drops to the fair invalid.

Lessingham stationed himself by her side; and fixing his eyes earnestly on her expressive countenance, he beheld the various emotions pourtrayed there, with a degree of admiration which he had never before experienced; and he was ready to cry out with the poet -—

<QuotedLit>"For different perfections have I loved different women; but thou so perfect peerless were created of every creature's best."</QuotedLit>

<DiaM>"I have ordered the carriage," <M>said Sir James, advancing to Lady Lawson</M>; "and as soon as Emily is better I will go."</DiaM>

Lady Horneck at this moment opened her eyes, and in a short time was able to sit up; when Sir James, in an air of tender reproach, said -— <DiaQ>"O Emily, how you trifle with your own constitution and my happiness!"</DiaQ>

Lady Horneck pressed his hand in silence; and with the assistance of his arm, she contrived to reach her carriage; and <ArrivalDeparture>the whole party soon after retired.</ArrivalDeparture>

The supper at Lady Lawson's was late. 

Miss Lawson appeared in high spirits; and no wonder, for she was seated between Mr. Lessingham and Mr. Isola.

Miss Clarion talked much and loud, and endeavoured to impress upon the minds of her hearers a sense of her learning.

Miss Pollet envied her situation; while Glaphyra was amused at the various efforts at wit which escaped the company: yet, though well entertained, she was nevertheless happy when the departure of the male part of it permitted her to retire for the night.</SceneDia> As soon as morning dawned the following day, she arose and dressed herself, anxiously waiting till the family were stirring, that she might have an opportunity of seeing her father, without intruding upon the time of Lady Lawson, and postponing her hour of breakfast: she found both her parents up; her father had rested well, and was in very good spirits; and having chatted over the events of the preceding night, she returned to Lady Lawson's.

<SceneAction>The breakfast being concluded, the younger part of the family began to concert plans for the morning's amusement, if two hours after mid-day could be so called.

<DiaM>"You can ride, can't you?" <M>asked Miss Clarion</M>. "I am sure I have seen you on horseback."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes, very well," <M>replied Glaphyra</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Oh! but that sha'n't be it neither; you shall ride -— I mean you shall go in Lady Horneck's curricle; Miss Lawson shall have your horse; I am engaged to drive Lessingham in his phaeton; Mr. Isola and Captain Dashwood will attend the two ladies on horseback; and perhaps Sir James and Mr. Lawson will join our party: Lawson, how will you go?"</Dia>

<Dia>"O! I will drive my phaeton against your's -— you know I have vowed to outdo you."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I hope Emily will stay at home this one day at least," <M>said Lady Lawson</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"O! but I am sure she wont," <M>replied her loquacious daughter</M>; "you know my sister never minds trifles, and she said she would be here at two this morning; and see," <M>continued she, pulling out her watch</M>, "it wants only ten minutes. Miss Laviton, you must hasten to prepare yourself."</DiaM>

Glaphyra would have excused herself; but no excuse was allowed; and she then hastened to acquaint her parents of her intention, and to slip on a riding-dress.

On her re-entrance at the house of Lady Lawson, she found Lady Horneck's carriage at the door; Mr. Lessingham, at the distance of a few paces, in his phaeton; and the different servants, with the horses, in waiting.

Lessingham, as soon as he saw Glaphyra, gave the reins to his servant; and joining her, he said -— <DiaQ>"Miss Laviton, how unfortunate, that I cannot have the pleasure of offering you a seat in my carriage -— this foolish engagement -— yet I rejoice to see you intend being of our party: I hope your amiable sensibility towards Lady Horneck has done you no injury."</DiaQ>

Glaphyra smiled: <Dia>"I was happy in the little assistance I was able to afford her; but you will scarcely believe me when I tell you that she is to be of the party this morning, and to drive me in her curricle."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I need no ghost to tell me this," <M>retorted Lessingham</M>; "and I only regret that I am condemned to the purgatory of knowing myself within the reach of your voice, and yet by fashion confined to the misery of Tantalus."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Is it impossible to converse with your sex rationally, and is one of mine never to hear the language of sincerity?" <M>said Glaphyra, with severity, as she opened the door of the breakfast-room</M>.</DiaM>

Lessingham pressed her hand in silence, and they entered the apartment together.

Lady Horneck looked ill and languid, yet she declared she had no symptom of indisposition remaining.

Lady Lawson shook her head; and Sir James, who was also present, replied -— <DiaQ>"I hope you are right, my love; but indeed I fear, you are so incautious: however, Miss Laviton, I hope you will not let her exert herself too much; at your hands I shall require my wife, for I really think you are the only sensible person of the whole party."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"The whole party are much obliged to you," <M>said Miss Clarion</M>; "and I shall, in consequence of your rudeness, outvote you: so, good people, <i>allons</i>."</DiaM>

The whole party, by unanimous consent, now rose to depart, and they were soon seated in the different vehicles.

Lessingham first assisting the ladies to mount, handed Lady Horneck and our heroine to their carriage; and then followed Miss Clarion, who, impatient of constraint, had already seized the reins, and leaped into his phaeton.

The riders set off in a canter, the carriages bowled after them; while Glaphyra, perceiving how little able to guide her horses Lady Horneck appeared, began to tremble at her own situation.

The canter of the equestrians, as they approached the Down, was accelerated into a gallop, while the carriage-horses, put on their mettle, were with difficulty restrained from following.

Fatigued with her exertions, Lady Horneck was scarcely able to hold the reins, when a party of fashionables, mounted on donkies, suddenly came in sight.

The animals now became quite unmanageable, and bounding over the sward, threatened instant destruction.

Lessingham at this moment leaped from his carriage, and by a circuitous way endeavoured to get between them and the precipice; the horses reared, plunged, and dashed forward -— twenty paces only remained between them and the inevitable gulph.

Lessingham was before them; he seized one of the horses by the head, but he was unable to hold it; he called to his servant, who now came up, to cut the traces.

The beasts, grown furious by restraint, now pawed the ground; and breaking from Lessingham, trampled him under their feet; and leaping the precipice, were out of sight in an instant; at the same moment the servant had fortunately disengaged the carriage from them.

Glaphyra, beholding the fall of Lessingham, and imagining that he was killed on the spot, seeing herself without a hope of preservation, covered her face with both hands, and uttering a pious ejaculation, pronounced the names of her parents, and sunk at the bottom of the carriage.

A concourse of people now gathered round the vehicle; and Lessingham, who had not received a very material injury, was one of the first to fly to the assistance of the ladies.

Lady Horneck had been some time before the accident in a state of insensibility, and she was now lifted out of the curricle by some of the spectators, who used every effort to revive her; while Lessingham, forgetting pain (for he had broken his arm) assisted in doing the same kind office to <AuthorWe>our heroine</AuthorWe>; his remaining arm encircled her waist; his eyes were fixed upon her lonely countenance, and his heart exulted in the hopes which this incident gave birth to; he would not have exchanged situations with an emperor.

Glaphyra opened her eyes; but as he stood behind her, she saw him not: the first word she uttered was his name.

Lessingham leaned forward: <DiaM>"Compose yourself," <M>cried he</M>, "lovely Miss Laviton; I am safe, and happy in having been so fortunate as to be the blessed instrument of your preservation."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Blessed indeed." <M>exclaimed Glaphyra</M>; "yet, had you died in the exercise of your benevolence, what a wretch I must have been! O, I never can forget it!"</DiaM>

Lessingham entreated her to be calm; and the servant approaching with a carriage which he had procured, the two ladies and Mr. Lessingham got in, and drove to the house of Lady Horneck.

In their way Glaphyra was much agitated at perceiving the arm of Lessingham, which hung inanimate at his side; he assured her it was a matter of little consequence; and requesting a surgeon might be sent for to bleed the two ladies, desired, that after that operation was performed, they would retire to bed.

<DiaM>"I must instantly go home," <M>said Glaphyra</M>, "lest this affair being mentioned suddenly, should alarm my parents."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That care be mine," <M>replied he</M>; "I will call upon them."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"O! no, no," <M>cried she</M>; "indeed you must not; you do not know the consequences -— consider your arm."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"If you go," <M>said he, smiling</M>, "I, of course, must attend you, or forfeit my politeness for ever; so you may as well remain here: I will also call on Lady Lawson. Good day."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ten thousand blessings attend you," <M>said Glaphyra, her eyes filling with tears as she spoke</M>; "you have for ever secured my gratitude."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"To purchase so sweet a smile, I would almost forfeit my existence," <M>cried he</M></DiaM>; and pressing her hand to his lips, he ran down stairs, where, throwing himself into the carriage, which still waited, he ordered it to drive as fast as possible to the house of Mr. Laviton; and supporting the invalid limb, which began to grow very painful, against the side of the chaise, he indulged, in spite of pain, in a pleasing reverie.</SceneAction>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. IV.</ChapMarker>

<ChapEpigraph>"A course of small, quiet attentions, not so pointed as to alarm, nor so vague as to be misunderstood, with now and then a look of kindness, and little or nothing said upon it -— leaves nature for your mistress, and she fashions it to her mind."
Sterne</ChapEpigraph>

LESSINGHAM needed no other introduction to the house and the hearts of Mr. and Mrs. Laviton, than that which the preservation of their daughter gave him; and from this time he almost lived in their society.

Glaphyra could not refuse paying every attention to the man who had preserved her life at the risk of his own; her friendship, her esteem, and her admiration, all that she could give, she had already given: but Glaphyra, while she felt an internal conviction, that ere long he meant to profess himself her admirer, felt also (or imagined she felt assured), that she could never again love any human being as she had once loved Lord Frederic Feverly; she remembered all that that unfortunate attachment had cost her; she recollected the tears she had shed, in secret shed to his memory, and the bitterness of that moment when she had torn herself from him forever; and she feared to encounter a second trial. Her situation was delicate in the extreme -— Lessingham had made no professions of attachment to her, he had never told her that he loved her; but his eyes, his manner, and his constant attendance at the house of her father, had said so a thousand times. <FIDambig>How to pay him a polite attention, without giving his hope encouragement, was the question; and yet how ungrateful must she appear! -— he had risked his life in her defence, and she was about to make him unhappy.</FIDambig>

Such were the reflections of Glaphyra; <RhetoricalQ>but what thought Lessingham?</RhetoricalQ> Lessingham was too well acquainted with the world and human nature, he had been too long and too intimately acquainted with the female world in particular, not to read the sentiments of Glaphyra in her conduct; he saw that she preferred his society to that of the general run of her male acquaintance, but such a preference was assuredly not sufficient to establish hopes upon; and he resolved to rest satisfied with his present situation, believing, that by a long course of silent attentions, he might prove ultimately successful. To Glaphyra herself he resolved not at present to address himself, but wait

<QuotedLit>Till time and industry, the mighty two 
Which bring our wishes nearer to our view,
Made him perceive that the inclining fair 
Receiv'd his vows with no reluctant ear.</QuotedLit>

Lessingham persisted in his attentions, yet his words spoke not; and while his arm continued in a sling, he felt an intuitive conviction that he could not be an object of indifference to <AuthorWe>our heroine</AuthorWe>.

Lessingham was not deceived: Glaphyra, as she bent her eyes towards his arm, as she remembered that it had been injured in her defence, insensibly softened her voice, her look, and her manner -— insensibly listened to his conversation with more than common earnestness -— received his civilities with complacency -— and gave him a degree of hope which encouraged him to persevere.

The prudence, however, which prevented him from opening his wishes to the daughter, induced him to confide his sentiments to the parents; and as to his fortune and connections, if was impossible any objection could be made, as his person and manners had attracted their admiration and respect, he found no difficulty started by them to impede his success; they approved of his conduct, they consented to his plans, and they wished that he might prove successful.

The introduction of <AuthorWe>our heroine</AuthorWe> by Lady Lawson had been followed by the civilities of a great many other ladies: Miss Clarion was the foremost amongst them; yet Glaphyra found it as much impossible to admire Miss Clarion, or even to feel herself comfortable in her society, as she did, on the other hand, feel it out of her power to withhold her regard and esteem from Lady Horneck, who possessed so many good qualities, and such a gentleness of manners, as could not fail to render her universally attractive.

<SceneDia>Lady Horneck offered to return the call of Miss Clarion with <AuthorWe>our heroine</AuthorWe>: <DiaM>"But, my dear," <M>said she, smiling</M>, "perhaps you do not know that Miss Clarion is one of the learned; she is, I assure you, quite scientific; indeed, it would be out of nature for a fair lady with her name to be otherwise -— in compliment to the Grecian Alcibiades, she was named by her parents Alcibidamia."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Impossible," <M>said Glaphyra, with a look of incredulity</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Now don't think, child," <M>retorted her Ladyship</M>, "that an arch look will get out the truth; I assure you, on my honour, it is fact: but this is Alcibidamia's habitation."</DiaM>

Lady Horneck now called her footman, bidding him enquire if Miss Clarion was at home. He soon returned with the information, that she would be happy to see the ladies, if they would excuse being shewn into the study; <DiaM>"For my lady is so busy," <M>continued the man</M>, "she has not been out these two days, and she hopes Lady Horneck and Miss Laviton will consider the difficulties of science."</DiaM>

Lady Horneck looked at Glaphyra, and Glaphyra laughed internally; <Blend>and they were soon at the door of Miss Clarion's academy of sciences.</Blend>

The man threw open the door, and discovered Miss Clarion painting; she threw a napkin over the subject which she was endeavouring to transfer to her paper, and rose hastily to receive her visitors, exclaiming -— <DiaQ>"How happy am I to receive you, dear Lady Horneck! this is a welcome intrusion. Miss Laviton, you quite enhance the merit of your visit by taking me in my academy."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"What is your present employment?" <M>asked Lady Horneck, advancing, and laying her hand on the napkin, in the act of removing it</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Stop," <M>cried Miss Clarion, seizing her arm</M>; "my dear creature, your visual orbs wont stand the sight of that original half statue -— look at the copy;"</DiaM> and she held up her drawing to the view of the two ladies.

<DiaM>"It is a horrid subject," <M>said Glaphyra</M>; "how painful must be the feelings of the first painter, if he copied from nature!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"An artist thinks of nothing but his picture," <M>retorted Miss Clarion</M>. "Do you recollect the story of the painter who put a poor man on the cross, and witnessed his dying agonies, to enable himself to have a correct idea of the Crucifixion? nay, I think he sat down at the moment, and copied from life."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Hideous!" <M>exclaimed Lady Horneck</M>. "Come, Miss Clarion, let us see the picture,"</DiaM> and she again put her hand,to the napkin; she withdrew it, and gave a loud shriek. Miss Clarion laughed, and Glaphyra turned away her face; for it was no picture, but the head of a malefactor, which Miss Clarion had purchased from the hospital at a large sum, and which she had now nearly copied.

<DiaM>"Faugh, how it stinks!" <M>said Lady Horneck, recovering her self-possession</M>; "I wonder how you could bear it."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"How do you like the copy?" <M>asked Miss Clarion</M>.</DiaM>

Lady Horneck turned pale. <DiaM>"I will thank you for a glass of water," <M>said her Ladyship</M><.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Let me put up the ventanna," <M>cried Miss Clarion, ringing the bell, and then running to throw up the sash</M>: "you will be better presently. I was fearful it would be too much for you; but those who follow science through all its mazes must not mind trifles. I have seen death exhibited in various ways; for whenever I hear of a person with a strongly-marked countenance being about to depart, I always petition to be present at the spectacle; and I can take notes for a picture as easily as a short hand writer can touch off an oration."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But your feelings," <M>said Glaphyra</M>; "they must be acute."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I take things scientifically," <M>replied the fair Alcibidamia</M>; "examine every ligament only with a view to obtain perfectability in one of my favourite arts; I combine attitude, I contemplate muscle, I trace fibre, every gradation of agony is to me matter of curiosity, and I think in my last picture I have given a pretty true representation of convulsion."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Were you ever present at the last moments of any dear friend?" <M>asked Glaphyra; but answering herself in the same moment, she continued</M>, "I presume not, for if you had, how must these scenes have harrowed up every dormant feeling!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I was at the death-bed of my own mother," <M>replied Alcibidamia</M>; "and that scene furnished me with one lesson in painting which I shall never forget -— the dear creature folded up her features in a sweetly-angelical smile, and I have copied her face upon canvas for a saint. If I could have given my credence to the miraculous tales I have heard of life and immortality, this would have convinced me; but, alas! I cannot be so deceived."</DiaM>

Glaphyra now looked at Miss Clarion with horror; she had never till this moment heard such sentiments broached by a female, and she felt that every virtue attached to the feminine character was lost in such impiety. <MonologueThought>"What dependance can be placed on the stability of that being," <M>cried she, mentally</M>, "who is guided by caprice and imbecility, whose conduct is governed by no rule of faith, and who relieth on the strength of her own fallible judgment, disbelieving the superintending care of an over-ruling Providence? what, in the hour of trial, will be her security? where, when temptation cometh from without, and the heart taketh part with the destroyer, can such a being find safety?"</MonologueThought>

Lady Horneck now rose to depart, and at the same moment Mr. Isola was announced. With a slight compliment they passed each other, and the ladies departed.</SceneDia>

<SceneDia><Graft>At the door</Graft> they were met by Lessingham, who requested to know if he might have permission to attend them in their walk?

<DiaM>"We are now going to an auction," <M>replied Lady Horneck</M>, "and I suppose that will hardly be interesting to you."</DiaM>

<Dia>"The pleasure of your society will compensate for any deficiency in the amusement I might otherwise find at an auction, only I must take care not to squeeze my poor arm out of its place again."</Dia>

<DiaM>"You had better not go," <M>said Glaphyra, earnestly</M>, "perhaps it may be very crowded."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You cannot persuade me that I shall be better any where than in your society," <M>retorted he, expressively</M>; "and surely you will not be cruel enough to turn me adrift."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I see, Miss Laviton, this man is resolved to stick to us, and therefore I am determined he shall not; so, Lessingham," <M>continued her Ladyship</M>, "I have a commission for you -— go to the habitation of Mr. Laviton, and say, that as Sir James is from home, I shall keep Miss Laviton to dinner; and as we must have a beau to introduce us into the rooms, you must make up our party, that is, if you can prefer the company of two fair ladies to that of the bottle."</DiaM>

Lessingham kissed the hand of Lady Horneck, and was about to quit them, when Glaphyra said, <DiaQ>"I thought you had promised Sir James to remain at home this evening."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Very true," <M>answered her Ladyship</M>; "I had forgot that; but it is of no consequence; promises, like pie-crust ---"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I am not fond of public places," <M>said Glaphyra</M>; "at least I hope I am not too fond of them; I had much rather spend a rational evening at home with your Ladyship; and I dare say Mr. Lessingham will for once bar ceremony, and make one in our sober party."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Sober," <M>repeated Lady Horneck</M>; "sober -— I wish my good man heard you; I am sure you would quite win his heart: but, Mr. Lessingham, can you bear a dull fireside of an autumnal evening?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"In such society," <M>cried be</M>, "what will be my pleasure! while thus conversing, I forget all time."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"We ourselves appear to have caught the infection, and to forget time too. I am not poetical, so I can only thank you for your politeness in plain prose: and now you must haste and fulfil your mission," <M>said Lady Horneck</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I shall join you at the auction," <M>replied he</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I think that man will make a good husband," <M>said Lady Horneck</M>; "don't you?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have never thought about it," <M>retorted Glaphyra</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Amazing!" <M>cried Lady Horneck</M>; "for if I am not greatly deceived, you are the only woman of his acquaintance whom he would wish to impress with that opinion."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"He appears a pleasant man," <M>said Glaphyra, smiling</M>; "and we have both reason to thank him for our preservation; his humanity will ever live in my memory: but as to his making a good husband, it is impossible we can ascertain that till he has been tried."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Why not?" <M>asked her companion</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Because," <M>replied our heroine, hesitating</M>, "it is the sterling qualities of the heart which alone can make a man pleasant always; the visiting countenance, the outdoor face, may be put on; a man or woman may disguise their sentiments, when interested; or I will even suppose that affection can render disguise unnecessary in the presence of an object loving and being beloved; but seen always, the scene changes."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Sir James Horneck has always been the same," <M>said her Ladyship</M>; "if possible, marriage has made him more kind and more indulgent; he appears fearful lest the slightest constraint should be put on my wishes; and I do not think that he ever contradicted me in his life, unless it was in something which concerned my health."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"If every man was like Sir James," <M>replied Glaphyra</M>, "one might be apt to suppose that every woman would be happy; and yet, dear Lady Horneck, the very woman who acknowledges his kindness, can be deaf to her own feelings and her husband's happiness, can trifle with a constitution naturally delicate, and pain two of the best hearts in existence."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Excellent, Glaphyra!" <M>said Lady Horneck</M>; "why am I not like you, consistent at all times?"</DiaM>

Glaphyra was about to reply as they entered the auction-room, <ArrivalDeparture>where they were soon after joined by Lessingham.</ArrivalDeparture>

<DiaM>"I am ready to die with laughing," <M>said he</M>; "I have met with the strangest adventure -— do you know that Isola is in love with Miss Clarion? he has this instant told me so himself; and that he may be certain of a return from the fair Alcibidamia, he is coming to buy up all the antiques, I mean the modern antiques, at the sale; he swears that the Cæsarian necklace lately seen in Bath shall be nothing to those he will procure for his intended bride -— that her habitation shall be fitted up like the temple of Minerva at Rome, or that of the great goddess Diana at Ephesus -— that she shall eat, drink, and sleep, after the ancient custom of any heathen or Christian nation which most accords with her own taste; and that he himself will find happiness in being the humblest of her slaves."</DiaM>

Lady Horneck laughed -— <DiaM>"She is a strange woman," <M>said she</M>; "yet she has been much admired."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"She is strikingly handsome," <M>said Glaphyra</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And she is sensible, I think," <M>continued Lady Horneck, in a tone of enquiry, directing her eye to that of Lessingham</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"She has very good sense," <M>replied he</M>, "if you can call that sense good which is misapplied -— the common duties of her sex she despises, and runs off on the hobby-horse of opinion, without a sufficient degree of stability to guide or direct her course; at one moment she is in search of wealth and a prosperous alliance, at another a modern philosopher, who despises all wealth but that of the mind; now she would imitate the boundless expence of the ancient Romans, and at another time she will run on for an hour on the simplicity of the ancients, and protest in favour of a dinner of herbs, with the sauce recommended by the wise man; as to ideas of religion, she has none, though I once heard her descant for an hour on the religion of nature."</DiaM>

Glaphyra was shocked. <DiaM>"I think a woman without religion -—" <M>said she, gravely; but checking herself, she added,</M> "my thoughts are, I believe, on this subject, a little old-fashioned, so I may as well keep them to myself."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Your thoughts, like your goodness, are too rare to be either fashionable or common," <M>replied Lessingham, warmly</M>; "but if you are too gentle to be severe on the faults of another, I see no reason that we should lose an observation worthy of being recorded; therefore, if you will not finish the sentence, you must suffer me to finish it for you -— I think a woman without religion the most dangerous, the most dreadful, the most desolate of human beings -— I believe you would have said all this."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It matters not what I would have said," <M>answered Glaphyra</M>; "you have now said it for me; but since our very thoughts are not safe in your presence, you are a dangerous companion -— we must take care of you."</DiaM>

Lessingham pressed the hand of Glaphyra between his; and as Lady Horneck was too much engaged in the business of the auction to bear any longer a part in the conversation, he whispered -—

<Dia><QuotedLit>"Glaphyra's eye did ne'er one thought reveal,
Which angels might not hear, and virgins tell."</QuotedLit></Dia>

<DiaM>"We must praise your poetical flights," <M>said Glaphyra</M>, "at the expence of your sincerity, and lament that our sex are ever beset with flattery; if I could believe all that you have uttered, I must give up my claim to humility."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Humility is an odd old-fashioned virtue," <M>answered Lessingham</M>; "you may as well turn him off, and get a new attendant."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Can you substitute any in his place?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Perhaps not."</Dia>

<Dia>"Then it is better to keep an old servant, however unfashionable, than to be without one."</Dia>

Lessingham smiled, and again pressed the hand of Glaphyra, which he had somehow or other contrived to retain during a part of this conversation; and as he resigned it, his eyes fully expressed the delight which the conversation of our heroine had afforded him.</SceneDia>

<Reader>Gentle reader</Reader>, <AuthorI>I have given</AuthorI> thee some slight sketch of the person of Mr. Lessingham, without any insight into his character but that which his conversation and manners may have afforded thee. This is not, perhaps, a common mode in works of imagination; but I do not mean to forestall <Book>my story</Book> -— it will unfold itself in due time, and I request thee to judge of him by his conduct; he appears to thee now as he appeared to <AuthorWe>our heroine</AuthorWe> at this stage of their acquaintance, at least, if the author has any skill in delineating character —- if she has not, she requests thy pardon and indulgence.

<SceneFragment>Mr. Lessingham and Glaphyra dined <i>en famile</i> with Lady Horneck, and in the evening that lady prevailed on her male visitor to favour them with reading a very popular modern production. Both ladies were enchanted; the sweet and well-modulated tones of his voice, the variety of his manner, and the interest he gave to the whole production, delighted them; and ere they had imagined the evening was half passed, Sir James surprised them by his return.

Delighted to find Lady Horneck so rationally employed, and so contrary was it to his expectations, that he could not help expressing his delight: <DiaM>"My dear Emily," <M>cried he</M>, "this is so good of you -— I am so happy to find you at home, soberly enjoying yourself with your work and a book. Miss Laviton, this is really friendly -— I feel myself truly grateful. Mr. Lessingham, I am obliged to you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ours is the obligation," <M>said Lessingham</M>; "I have spent a most delightful evening."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"We have never thought of the hour," <M>cried Glaphyra</M>, "and it is now near midnight."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I do not think we could have spent a pleasanter evening had we been at the ball," <M>replied Lady Horneck</M>; "only your company, Sir James, was wanting to render it quite enchanting."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And to me," <M>said Sir James, emphatically</M>, "no amusement ever compensated for the loss of my family fireside; judge, then, how tiresome has been the dull routine of lawyers and parchments."</DiaM>

Lessingham now rose to depart, and the family soon after retired to rest.</SceneFragment>
