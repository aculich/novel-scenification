<ChapTitle>CHARACTER OF PHILO -— AN EXEMPLARY CLERGYMAN.</ChapTitle>

<ChPortrait>PHILO, the Hero of this Ramble, was the only son of a gentleman who lived in a sequestered part of England. Upon the demise of his father, which happened at the time he had arrived to the age of twenty-four, he found himself in the possession of five hundred pounds a year, with the respectable adjuncts of an old woman, his housekeeper, a boy, and <i>Thomas Sturdy</i>, a stout fellow about forty, who had been a very honest and useful drudge in the family from the days of his childhood.

<i>Philo</i> had received that moderate degree of education, which left his mind at the age to which he had advanced, entirely free from every prejudice with respect either to religion or politics, and he viewed the Deity, and his obligations to the supreme Being, in his works. -— He saw, in the beauties that presented themselves constantly before his eyes, the traces of an omnipotent power, and he required no teacher to inform him of that which was self-evident. He rejoiced with the sun, moon, and stars, he leaped with the bounding roe, he sauntered with the peaceful flocks and herds, and contemplated, with raptures ineffable, <FIDambig>the waving woods, the nodding groves, the limpid fountains, the purling streams, the smiling meadows, and all the wanton decorations with which the spring unfolds herself to charm, to ravish, and astound mankind.</FIDambig> He required no preceptor, but the objects before him, to instil into his mind the relative duties, and the necessity there was for him to display the virtues of a faithful member of society. He saw, as in an unsullied mirror, the <i>rights</i> between man and man, and the palpable claims upon him, in his dealings with his neighbour, to adhere to that golden axiom, of <i>doing unto others as he would they should do unto him</i>. The volume of nature lay open to him, and he sought for no other guide. He had religiously executed the offices of a dutiful son to his parents, and, having been an only son, he was their dearest object. He perceived, during their lives, he could not make an excursion beyond the precincts of the hamlet where he was born, and the adjoining hills and dales, without giving them infinite pain and anxiety. They were a couple of simpletons, who married at such an advanced time of life that it was next to a miracle they should be blessed with such a son; they were, consequently, fond of him to distraction; and, even, in his riper days, when the desire of stepping forth into the great world presses still more and more upon the fancy, they were become so old and unreasonable, that they could not bear him out of their sight. He was the prop of their age, the staff upon which they leaned, and all the joy and comfort of their declining hours. He saw all this with many a commiserating tear. He possessed that goodly frame of mind which gives up one's own conveniences and pleasures to gratify the too-over-weening claims of those we love; and as the <i>old</i> are apt to view every attempt of the <i>young</i>, to think for themselves, as a slight to the superior judgment of gray hairs, he modestly kept himself within the bounds of his parish, and his attention to his parents, until their death, which happened nearly at the same time.</ChPortrait>

PHILO, at this most interesting aera of his life, found himself in a very perplexed situation. Although he had a sufficient patrimony to gratify his utmost wishes, yet, so closely had he been immured by the solicitudes of his late and beloved parents, that he was utterly a stranger to the ways of the world. He had seen nothing of them but what had occurred to him in the trifling circle of the hamlet in which he resided, and that having been sufficient, only, with the addition of his extreme good sense and fine natural parts, to fix his mind firmly in the principles of a good man, he wished to travel into a more enlarged society of his fellow creatures for the purpose of taking a survey of their actions. He had a fine person, was healthy and strong, and possessed that share of natural complacency and address, which is not to be equalled by the most finished education upon a barren stock; yet he was diffident from the want of experience about the mode of his travels, and the manner in which he might be received wherever he went. —- He spent his time, after having paid every respect to the memory of the deceased, in settling the affairs of his house, and in the contemplation of a Ramble through the adjacent counties, and at last came to the resolution of making his first essay, with his man <i>Sturdy</i>, afoot, without any incumbrance in the world but a neat suit of clothes upon his back, and a change of linen slung in a wallet over the shoulder of his servant. This determination pleased him the more, as the surrounding hills and dales, and the neighbouring mountains, together with the infinite variety of delightful recesses to be found in his intended peregrination, would be more accessible in this mode of travelling than in any other; and he could loiter at his ease, or take post horses, or a carriage, as it might suit his inclination or convenience. He was still more pleased with the prospect he had in view in this mode of rambling, from his natural propensity to enjoy the uninterrupted contemplation of the works of God, and the admirable display of the beauties of nature, which are to be met with in the most obscure, and the remotest paths of the creation. He felt something like a monitor within his breast, that was continually putting him in mind of the inexhaustible fund of amusement he would find in the fields, should he meet with any thing to damp his spirits among mankind, and being quite a novice in the world he knew not what might happen, and he had his doubts, fears, and perturbations, concerning the matter.

<i>Philo</i> had seldom conversed with any but his parents, except a <i>simple</i> clergyman of his parish, as innocent in his manners as himself, who was his principal companion, confident, and friend, and with whom he had studied natural philosophy, and read some of the best moral productions; and, upon the whole, he had filled up his time in his retirement, in a very agreeable manner. But his principal pleasures and pursuits having been in the pastoral way, he knew as little of mankind from books as from his own experience. He had minded more in his walks the birds and the flowers, than the concerns of his neighbours, and had rarely heard, during his life, of any quarrel among them. His friend, the <i>parson</i>, had enjoyed a small living under his benefactor the father of <i>Philo</i>, from the time of his first taking orders until now that he was fifty years of age. He had attended the son from his infancy as his instructer in the rudiments of letters, and was happy and contented with the kindnesses he received from the family, in which he had been a constant table companion. When <i>Philo</i> grew up to be such a promising young man, this family, consisting of the old people, the clergyman, and <AuthorWe>our <i>Hero</i></AuthorWe>, composed a little sequestered <i>Elysium</i> of rural deities, where no vices were known, nor any troubles exhibited, except the blessed contentions of reciprocal good offices, and the happy exertions of disinterested friendship. But, alas! as all sublunary situations must have an end, this knot of intimates was broken by the death of the old people; and <i>Philo</i>, from a desire to see the world, was now upon the brink of leaving, for a time, his friend, the <i>parson</i>, to bewail his loss with the genuine tears of sensibility and regret.

This PARSON was a GOOD MAN; he never entered into the vanities of THEOLOGICAL disquisitions, to CONFOUND his congregation; he preached the word of PEACE to his parishioners, served GOD, and was QUIET.

From such an inoffensive and sequestred community in which he had been brought up, <i>Philo</i>, even at the age of twenty-four (the time that most other young men have acquired all the knowledge of the world they ever will possess to advantage) was like a sheet of fine paper, as white and printless as the new-fallen driven snow. His mind had received no turns or impressions towards any settled notions of men and their manners. He had all the desirable propensities imaginable, which were blessings he derived from the very great simplicity and benevolence of his parents and the clergyman, but more especially from the natural sweetness of his own temper, and the benignity of his own heart. -— If he had any glimmering of an opinion of the rest of mankind, from the few he had seen, it was as yet founded upon a belief only, that every body else was as innocent as himself, and that he should find in the larger circles of societies, with which he was about to mix, the exquisite delights of universal harmony, general munificence, and all the social virtues. The tempters to vice, and the impostors under all denominations, together with the pride and envy of the human race, were circumstances entirely out of his thoughts, having never entered therein; and as the time was now arrived that he was to launch forth into the world, his former doubts and fears were subsided, and he was all on tiptoe to be gone. -— He expected nothing less than the exquisite delights of his being immediately plunged into the most charming scenes of bliss and good fellowship -— <FIDambig>into the most joyful intercourse of angelic beings —- into raptures ineffable! -— songs and seraphic triumphs, and all the gorgeous fooleries of the most splendid imagination, could not superadd one idea to the enchanting prospect he had in view of <i>unutterable felicity!</i></FIDambig> ---- <Apostrophe>O excellent <i>Philo!</i> O, excellent young man! -— but you must be left, for a little time, with the flattering caresses of hope and expectation, while your faithful man <i>Sturdy</i> is introduced, before he enters upon a scene of action, in which he will cut no inconsiderable figure.</Apostrophe>

<ChapTitle>CHARACTER OF PHILO's MAN STURDY.</ChapTitle>

<ChPortrait>THOMAS STURDY was a kind-hearted <i>fellow</i> that would not hurt a fly, but, at the same time, he was as resolute as a lion in the defence of the weak or oppressed, and in the castigation of the cruel offender against the dictates of humanity. -— Added to this turn of mind, he was master of a strength of body, that enabled him upon every occasion, where his prowess was necessary, to second the goodness of his deposition, to strike terror and dismay to all opposition; but having not the smallest particle of a savage about him, he had never carried his <DoxaQuotes>"deep sense of injury"</DoxaQuotes> to excess, and was immediately appeased, as the intended mischief of his opposer subsided, or the culprit was struck, by his powerful arm of justice and benevolence, with seeming sorrow and contrition.

He had been bred in the family of <i>Philo</i> from his youth, and partook of the mildness of the gentle government under which he served; but having had a great deal to do in the out-business of the household, he was daily led into those little occurrences of imposition and tricks among the villagers, with whom he chaffered for his employers, that had oftentimes irritated his honest passions in favour of his master, to the tune of a broken head, or a toss into the kennel, to the offender. He was a merry fellow, and his resentments always bore some tokens of drollery, or of jokes, but they were frequently thought serious ones by those that felt them. He loved a cup of ale, when he had nothing else to do, and tippled, now and then, at the sign of the <i>Lion and Lamb</i>, by the side of the parish church-yard, with the blacksmith and the country bumpkins. He was looked upon, by the customers, to bear an exact resemblance to the <i>sign</i>, for he exhibited the gentleness of the <i>lamb</i>, or the fierceness of the <i>lion</i>, according to the different lights he was thrown into by the case in question. He was always the umpire in disputes at the alehouse, and, generally, settled them to the satisfaction of all parties; at least he was sure to punish the aggressor with a <i>tear-drawing</i> squeeze by the hand, a <i>rap</i> over the knuckles, a <i>shove</i> into the horse-pond, or a <i>trip-up</i> of the heels, to the great entertainment of the rest of his companions.

From these circumstances, and the busy turn of this happy fellow, it may be doubted whether <i>Thomas</i> was not the most learned man in the family of <i>Philo</i>, respecting the little world he lived in. All the buyings and sellings in small matters were left to him, so that he was continually in those disputes that procured him a knowledge of the people he had to do with, which the family never dreamed of. All being quiet and smooth with them, and the necessary provisions for their table, together with the accounts of the same, having been faithfully administered by <i>Sturdy</i>, with the assistance of the old woman their housekeeper, they troubled not their heads with the matter. Their rents were <i>duly paid</i> by the tenants, because the tenants were not <i>oppressed</i>; and the delightful even course of tranquillity, in which they whiled away the fleeting hours with their son and the parson, prevented their taking any notice of <i>Sturdy</i>'s wranglings with the butcher, or the baker, or any other part of his brawls or merriment among the villagers; excepting, that upon all extraordinary occasions which happened to come to their knowledge, as well as upon the whole of his conduct, they found him to be, generally, in the right, with regard to his intentions, and, always, a faithful well-meaning servant, that would do any thing for his master.</ChPortrait>

<ChapTitle>PREPARATIONS FOR PHILO's RAMBLE.</ChapTitle>

BUT now that the time was arrived which closed the scene with the old people, and they were gone quietly to their graves, to a long sleep, or to be called forth by the God that made them into future regions of unknown existence, where no human history can trace them, <AuthorWe>we</AuthorWe> must leave their benign spirits, wishing everlasting peace to them wherever they may be wandering, and attend to the ramble of their son, who is launching into almost as new a state to him, of the affairs and bustlings of this world, as the departed souls of his parents may have been plunged into, in another.

<i>Philo</i> had had frequent consultations with his friend the <i>parson</i> about the management of his family during his absence, the result of which was, that the housekeeper and the boy were deemed sufficient guardians of the premises, and more especially as the clergyman undertook the superintendence of his other affairs. He was to see to the paying and receiving of all money matters, as a steward to the young man; and it was happy for him he had fallen into such good hands; for though the <i>parson</i> had not seen, of late years, much more of mankind than his patron, yet his good sense, honesty, and uprightness of character, was a bulwark to the uncomplicated estate and concerns of <i>Philo</i>, against all the impostors and cheats in the world.

The parson was exceeding glad to find that the coming at once to the sole possession of a clear estate, with money and savings besides, made no vain impressions upon the mind of so young a man. He was happy that, instead of purchasing fine horses, and an attempt to cut an amazing figure, in his first approaches in life, <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> had nothing more in view, at this trying time, than a <i>ramble</i> with <i>Sturdy</i>, and that in the humble simplicity of a walk through the neighbouring country.

<i>Sturdy</i> was a fellow whom the <i>parson</i> loved for his fidelity, and who, he was convinced, would stand by his master upon all occasions of difficulty, should there be any need for his exertions.

<SceneQuasi>On the evening preceding the day that the excellent <i>Philo</i> was to leave the peaceful hamlet where he had so constantly resided; where he had been daily seen in such a lane, in such a grove, or in such a field or meadow, and was known by, and knew, every shepherd in the parish, the <i>parson</i> shed many a silent tear of sorrow, while he squeezed the hand of his parting friend, which would, at any other time, have been noticed by <i>Philo</i>, but he was now too full of hope and expectation to regard any thing but the morrow, and his wishes for fine weather, and unutterable delights. The old woman, the housekeeper, did nothing but sigh, and moan, in an old cane chair, for the impending loss of her dear <i>Philo</i>, and, like a good motherly matron, she poured tears and blessings for him upon her apron as plenteously as the gracious drops of an April shower, which brings fertility and happiness to the jocund plains.

---- She was a good old woman, <Sententia>which is a very good thing to have in a family</Sententia>, and the best hand at a <DoxaItalics><i>flood of tears</i></DoxaItalics> of any old woman in the parish.

The poor boy could not help thinking, now that his young master was going to leave the house, all the world was at an end with him, and he whimpered and snubbed in the kitchen till he was as melancholy, poor lad, as a weeping log of green wood upon a drowsy fire. As to <i>Sturdy</i>, he did nothing during the evening but bustle about for the necessary accommodations of his master. He got his wallet stuffed with every thing he wanted for that purpose -— mended the straps of it, and made a snug partition in it for his own affairs. -— He laughed at the old woman, when she came out of the parlour with her eyes as red as a ferret's, and lugged the lad by the ears for a snivelling son of a w——-. He was all on fire, and ready to burn a barn, or to sacrifice his life to save one from the flames. He was up to any thing in the world but a deliberate intention of harm. He kissed the <i>cook</i> twenty times over, who was a necessary personage whom we had forgot to mention before, and one that did not mind of a goose's feather, any thing besides her spits and gridirons. -— He slapped her upon the shoulders, and hugged her in his arms, and whistled and sung himself out of breath, <DoxaQuotes>"to drive away sorrow and care."</DoxaQuotes></SceneQuasi>

<ChapTitle>PHILO's DEPARTURE.</ChapTitle>

<SceneOther>HAVE <Reader>you</Reader> seen a fine fresh young man, much like, in appearance, to a gentlemanly farmer's son, with auburne locks curling round his neck, with ruddy health blooming upon his cheeks, with an open, sprightly, and ingenuous countenance, such that, without a blush, would raise in the innocent bosom of the pure and simple virgin the hymeneal sensations? then <Reader>behold</Reader> <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> issuing from his house, and rushing hastily through the village, upon a May morning that was as blithesome and gay as himself -— look upon the background, and observe the <i>parson</i>, like the picture of despondence, standing near the court-gate, and, with the last look of deep regret after his departing friend, sending forth to his Maker, the most ardent prayers for the good of his patron, that the goodness of the best of hearts could send -— <Reader>see</Reader> the old woman, the housekeeper, crying in the porch, with the boy sobbing by her side -— <Reader>observe</Reader> the <i>cook</i>, running and laughing after <i>Sturdy</i>; who, with his wallet upon his back, and dressed in a clever brown fustian suit, is following his master -- <Reader>note</Reader> the cluster of <i>Thomas</i>'s acquaintance upon a green plat, with their hats off, greeting the gentle <i>Philo</i> as he passes, while he, with a modest farewell smile, takes with him all their hearts -— <Reader>see</Reader> the country hobbies encircle the merry <i>Thomas</i> as he advances, and clapping him upon the back, and shaking him by the hands, while they press him to take good care of his master, and keep himself out of scrapes -— <Reader>look</Reader> to the village wenches, scampering from their habitations, and, with the corner of their aprons to their faces, chuckling, and simpering, and fleering , they know not why, at the novelty of the scene before them -— <Reader>see</Reader> the ancient rustics, at their doors, crying <DiaQ>"Lord ha' mercy on us, and God save the young gentleman, and bring him safe home again"</DiaQ> -— then <Reader>you will have a full display before your imagination of <i>Philo</i>'s departure,</Reader> and the mode in which he and his man <i>Sturdy</i> vanished from their native hamlet, and much lamenting friends, into the adventrous search of pleasures among the distant, more polished, and more numerous inhabitants of the earth.</SceneOther>

<ChapTitle>PHILO's EMBARRASSMENTS IN HIS PROGRESS.</ChapTitle>

PHILO had walked a considerable way before his man <i>Sturdy</i>, whom he had left laughing and prating with the villagers, and was ruminating over the first thoughts and suggestions that occurred to him, in consequence of his having just emerged from his peaceful home and its concerns, and his perceiving himself to be instantaneously removed into an entire new scene and its prospects, when he was roused from his revery, by the uncertainty of the path he was to pursue, and his want of <i>Sturdy</i>'s assistance upon the occasion; for he had now got as far upon the way as he had been acquainted with.

<i>Thomas</i> having staid in the hamlet until he began to be alarmed at his neglect, flew after his master upon the wings of duty and respect, and joined our hero just in time to save his credit, and to conduct him along the road.

They had not proceeded many miles before an entire new country presented itself to the eyes of <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe>, and engaged all his affections. Lofty mountains, whose ample sides were fringed with woods, bursting forth into foliage, struck him with still greater veneration for the <i>deity</i>, and he was all astonishment at the wonderful display of his <i>omnipotence</i>; while the birds, the choristers of the vale, in wild and rapturous melody, joined him in the extremity of his sensibility, and uttered notes to the praise of the great disposer of all things, that no human tongue can express, and <i>Philo</i> was, for some time, totally lost in the inexplicable delights of speechless adoration.

The awful appearance of the mountains, and the beautiful variety of the winding dales that clung round their feet, and seemed, in submissive guise, to present to their <DoxaQuotes>"HIGH MIGHTINESSES"</DoxaQuotes> the sweet blandishments of the flowery meads, and the delightful wanderings of the gliding streams, exhibited such an impetuous diversity of heavenly objects to the warm imagination of <i>Philo</i>, that he was ready to run mad with the pleasures of his ramble, and the thoughts of future joys and unceasing raptures; when his man <i>Sturdy</i>, after many unavailing attempts to draw to himself his master's attention, declared, with uncommon vehemence, that they had entirely mistaken their way, by missing a turn in the road which he had let slip his memory -— that he was now totally out of his knowledge -— and that it was necessary, immediately, and without loss of time, to endeavour to rectify the mischance, or they might both <FIDitalics><i>rue</i></FIDitalics> the day they had ever set out from home!

<i>Philo</i>, in his consultations with the <i>parson</i>, had fixed upon his route with respect to the towns and public haunts of men, that lay at the distance of thirty, fifty, and eighty miles from home, but he had left the management of the road to the first public inn on his way, in which he could have any tolerable accommodations, to the sagacity of <i>Thomas</i>, well knowing, from the <i>parson's</i> intelligence and instructions, that when he got there he should be in a more direct and frequented line to the completion of his wishes.

This inn was not more than twenty miles, country reckoning, from <i>Philo</i>'s hamlet, but the road to it being through a mountainous and woody tract of land, was a difficult way to find by accidental travellers, and was not used in general except by an <i>extra</i> post-boy and the principal farmers. <i>Sturdy</i> had, once or twice, during the course of his service in the family, been dispatched upon his old friend <i>Dobbin</i>, the <i>gray horse</i>, to the aforesaid inn, to make enquiries after wines and other commodities for his master, that were delayed by the negligence of the people of the house to which they were sent, or the carrier, who conveyed in a cart occasionally, and when he had a sufficient load, which was not often the case, all the hampers, casks, and flasks, &c. that were directed to <i>Philo</i>'s family, or any other of the inhabitants of their remote part of the island.

The sudden attack of <i>Sturdy</i> upon <i>Philo</i> about the road, when the latter was rapt up in the moft divine meditations -— when the operations of his fancy held forth to him the most exquisite and unbounded transports in the prosecution of his ramble, was a violent stroke upon his nerves; it was a blow the more severe to him, because <i>Sturdy</i> used to laugh at, and make sport with, every occurrence in his department; but now that he should accost his master with such a grave countenance, and so frequently urged, before <i>Philo</i> could divest himself of the pleasantest thoughts that had ever entered his head, and conclude these shocking grimaces with a positive assertion that they were so lost and bewildered, that if they did not instantaneously employ their best wits to get into the right track again, they would <FIDitalics><i>rue</i></FIDitalics> the day they had ever set out from home, was a monstrous check upon his ardour and spirits. —- He began to perceive that all was not to go on so smoothly as he had expected, that entering into a new scene of life was not such a fine thing as he had thought it would be, and that it was not to be done without meeting with some rubs and interruptions. -— He found himself in a situation that dashed at once his happy contemplations -— he was obliged to listen entirely to <i>Sturdy</i>'s admonitions, and he was forced to set himself hard and fast to work, with his man, for the first time in his life, to get out of the first difficulties, trifling as they were, into which he had ever been plunged.

There were two causes that made <i>Sturdy</i> so violent in his attack upon his master. The first and principal one was, that as he had taken upon himself the task of conducting <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> safe to the inn, he was exceedingly agitated that he had missed the short turning in the road; and the other proceeded from his master's hurrying on before him, with his nonsensical addresses to the mountains and vallies, still farther out of the way, and in the most entangled and unfrequented paths imaginable, before he could get him to listen to a word he had to say upon the matter; so that the poor fellow's vehemence was a natural consequence of his situation.

<SceneAction>In the present embarrassed state of their affairs <i>Thomas</i> and his <i>master</i> went up and down the various and endless tracks among the brambles, goss-bushes, tall trees, and short wood, in search of any living creature from whom they might be furnished with some kind of intelligence how they were to get on in the world, without being obliged to execute the disgraceful task of tracing their steps back again. -— After a good deal of anxiety and trouble, they found a wood-cutter, <FID>who said he did no' travel much -— he had heard there was such a road as they inquired for some miles off -— but, for his part, he did no' know that there was any way to it, that he could just now think on -— howsomee'r, if they would go down into yonder valley, then through that coppice, up the next hill, leaving those great mountains on the right side, they would presently come to his neighbour <i>Goody Gadfly</i>'s, who, he hoped, knowed more of the matter than himself,</FID> for, said he, <DiaQ>"her has gotten the <i>devil</i> of a <i>tongue</i>."</DiaQ>

With this information they were fain to be content, and they were the rather so, as these greatest of all the mountains about them, and which drew Philo so hastily out of his way, <i>Thomas</i> recollected lay much to the right of the road he had lost. -— They were fortunate enough not to encounter many difficulties in tracing out <i>Goody Gadfly's</i>. -- They found her by the side of her cottage throwing some draff, and talking very fast to a <i>porket</i>, while the animal acted its part exceedingly well in unison with her, and squealed and grunted impatiently.

<DiaM>"Lord ha' mercy!" <M>exclaimed this pert old woman, as soon as she saw her visiters</M>, "where done you come from, and how did ye find such a loanly place as this?"</DiaM> <DiaM>"Why dame," <M>replied Thomas</M>, "we came from <Cryptonym>---</Cryptonym> and are going to <Cryptonym>——-</Cryptonym>, but we have, somehow, got out of the road, and wish to be put into it again."</DiaM>  -- <DiaM>"Why now, odds dickins," <M>rejoined <i>Goody Gadfly</i></M>, "I thought as much -- for nobody comes here but what are lost folks. -— Gods bethank it, I ha' got a little pig here, as you may see, if you'll look at him, and I ha' got a <i>pleck</i> o' peas and beans coming up, and if this fine weather continues, there is no doubt in the versal world but I shall make a shift to scromble on -— for you mun know that it is hard work for poor folks to live, when they mun depend upon themselves as I do, for I'll assure you, there's nobody lives hereabouts but my neighbour <i>Thomas Thump</i>, the wood-cutter, a simple fellow, in troth, he is, and labours, withal, mighty hard, and that for a plaguy little; for you mun know, all this part of the country belongs to 'Squire <i>Lackrent</i>, and he has no' much to show for it, neither, but a parcel of great bromble woods, that bring him in little or nothing, and a deal o' meadow lond that's o'ergrown with nothing but cowslips, crocuses, lady-smocks, rough bents, and vermin -— so that the poor cattle are starved with wet and domps all the winter, and not much better off in the summer, for, poor creatures, they are so often flooded from the mountains -— but, poor things, if you wan to see them ith' heat o' summer, when the flies plague 'em so nationly, how they cock their tails so comically, and frisk it o'er the lond, it would do your hearts good, and make you loffe till your sides ached again, that it would. -— He! he! he!" <M>chuckled the old woman</M>, "I have been ready to --- he! he! he! -— money a time at their gallops and vigaries -— he! he! he!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Whew," <M>screamed <i>Thomas</i>, in chorus with her</M>, "the devil's in the woman," <M>said he</M>, "what's all this to do with our inquiries?"</DiaM> -— <i>Philo</i> turned away his face, and blushed, while <i>Goody Gadfly</i> proceeded.

<Dia>"Now, I suppose you think, from your frowning upon a body, poor folks mu'n't be merry."</Dia>

<i>Philo</i> turned instantly about, and discovered a countenance of entire satisfaction with the old woman's chearful remark, while <i>Thomas</i> unbent his brow a little, and felt something of his original and unruffled pleasantry creep round his heart.

<DiaM>"Why look you here," <M>continued <i>Goody Gadfly</i></M>, "thof I see but little company, now-a-days, I am never molicholy, not I -— I sussle about, and chatter to my <i>pig</i>, or my <i>cock</i>; -— but, 'las the day! I ha' lost poor <i>Turpin</i> -— the faithfulest dog! -— O dear heart! I shall never forget the day he died -— as how he panted and struggled to look me i'th' face, as much as to say, I ne'er shall see you, <i>Goody Gadfly</i>, no more! -- Well, my heart has suffered mony a pang after him -— you mu'no' be angry with me for sheding some tears, for I conno' help it. -— But, as I was saying -— Lord bless me! I wish I wa'n't so foolish —- that as how -— when poor <i>Turpin</i> dont come into my head, I con talk to the pretty singing birds, or any thing else -— and to see as how they sit upon a bush, and whistle all the day long -— why, now, how merry this is! -— what con a body want more? -— and then the sweet <i>robin</i> that comes hopping about one, and cocks up its eye, and looks so cunning, the little rogue,-— O! it does my heart good to throw it some crumbs when it is winter, and snows so sadly -— and when the dear thing ruffles up its feathers, and comes in at the door, and pops about the stools and benches, and looks and peeps at one so fearfully -- who could be so hard-hearted as to fright it away, and not to give it something to do it good and keep it from starving? -— Well, Lord bless me! -— my poor husband -— he died mony years ago —- God rest his soul -— how mad he used to be when our son, <i>wicked Dick</i>, would throw stones at the birds, and frighten the poor <i>robin</i> out of its senses -— but he ran away from us when he growed up to be a great lad, and went for a soldier, and was killed, -- and my daughter Bet lives at 'Squire <i>Lackrent</i>'s, and that is all the comfort I have now left me, besides my <i>garden</i>, my <i>pig</i>, and my <i>cock</i> --- O Lord ha marcy! -- see how he comes there, chuckling and glavering his <i>hen</i> -- O! they bin the sweetest companions in the world, and better by half than all your proud folks put together! -— Thos they bin both little ones, they bring me a mortal deal of eggs to serve me, with a little bacon, to live on all the year round. I never want any thing more, besides garden-stuff, and don't see a bit o' what they callen butcher's meat from one year's end to t'other -— no, nor I don't want it neither, that I don't. -— <i>Thomas Thump</i>, my neighbour, <i>sticks my pig</i> when its fat and in well liking, and I give the poor mon some of the offals for his labour; for he is willing to labour about my matters, as well as he con -- but he is but a slow hand, I assure you, and I am forced to drive him about a plaguy deal, or I should no' make much on him."</DiaM>

<i>Philo</i> was beginning to think that <i>Goody Gadfly</i>'s larum would never cease, when her attention was diverted from her unremitting rattle to a furious engagement which was commencing between her <i>bantling cock</i> and <i>Sturdy</i>.

<i>Thomas</i> having perceived the stately strutting of the little chanticleer to be a sort of defiance to him, had so far imitated it in the clapping of its wings and crowing, that he had fairly irritated, at last, the little fierce and angry fool to a ferious attack upon his hat, which he held, in a threatening posture, towards it, for an object of its wrath and contention. -— The contest soon began to be so warm between <i>Thomas</i> and the <i>cock</i>, and the latter repeated its strokes against the hat with such invincible rage, that <i>Sturdy</i> thought fit to retire and parry at a distance, while his hot antagonist advanced upon him, and pecked the ground in defiance, and, with the feathers of its neck ruffled up in a ring like the ruffs in the days of the good queen <i>Eliza</i>, it was so furious and determined, that it must have driven the stout <i>Sturdy</i> entirely off the field, had he not, with a quick and invidious motion, clapped his hat over the whole body of the <i>cock</i>, and pressed it to the earth, in durance the most pitiable that could be conceived for such an heroic bird.

<i>Thomas</i>, not content with his victory, which was not a fair one, drew the little prisoner from under his hat, and, placing its head close under one of its wings, and with both his hands pressing them both to its sides, he whirled it about with such velocity, that when he had done, and had laid it upon the earth before him, it continued there as a dead thing, and, seemingly, without its head, until the humane <i>Philo</i> relieved it from its trance, and it ran away, terrified out of its natural courage, and joined its mate, the frizled hen, in loud and clamorous notes of distress.

During the whole of the combat <i>Goody Gadfly</i> laughed till she seemed ready to split into a hundred pieces, and declared, when she had breath enough to do it, she had never seen better sport in all her born days -— and when the <i>cock</i> was gone, and all was over, she said it should attack <i>Sturdy</i> again in five minutes, and fight him as bravely as it had done before -— but Philo now becoming impatient to proceed on his ramble, prevailed upon <i>Goody Gadfly</i> to desist -— and, after peeping into the inside of her cot, where he perceived all was neat and cleanly in the extreme -— her pewter dishes and plates scoured as bright as silver, and her coarse stools and tables rubbed as smooth as mahogany, he pressed her to give him, immediately, some information about the way to the inn, if she was really able, and to accept of him some silver, which he offered her, to keep up that wonderful flow of spirits during the remainder of the day, which she had hitherto employed so much to his satisfaction.

<i>Goody Gadfly</i>, after having discharged a whole volley of compliments, in her way, at <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> for his generosity, declared she knew nothing now of the road to the inn he inquired for; she had formerly been acquainted with all the country hereabouts, but for many years past she had never gone farther than to 'Squire <i>Lackrent</i>'s to see her daughter <i>Bet</i>, and he lived up among the woods quite out of the way to any where else. -— She hoped to the Lord he might find his way somehow -- for, said she, <DiaQ>"it must be a terrible blind road, I assure you, in such a tangled part o'th' world as this is."</DiaQ>

<i>Philo</i> now finding that he was utterly lost in a strange country, where no intelligence could be obtained how he was to get out of it, made a virtue of necessity, and applied to his own feelings upon the occasion the chearfulness of the old woman, who whether it was rough or smooth with her, she seemed to be supplied with such a fund of goodhumour and spirits, that no disasters nor disappointments could disturb. -— He made his comments upon her and his own situation very much like a real philosopher, and he found peace and comfort to take their places in his breast, and all the troublesome guests that had lodged in it before, in consequence of his embarrassment, to vanish like a pack of knaves and impostors as they were. -— He began to be exceedingly pleased with the character of <i>Goody Gadfly</i>, and smiled at her seeming to set her heart upon some new scheme that would excite either merriment or tears. He perceived her passions to be always upon a gallop -— that she could laugh and cry in a breath -— and that it was a hard matter to decide which of those two extremes afforded her the most happy and delightful moments of her life. -— He at last, however, found it necessary to force himself away from her, and <i>Sturdy</i> obeyed the summons of his master with his wonted diligence, while <i>Goody Gadfly</i> sent forth her powerful stream of blessings after them, and <i>laughed</i> and <i>wept</i> them out of sight.</SceneAction>

<ChapTitle>PHILO's FARTHER DIFFICULTIES.</ChapTitle>

PHILO no sooner got clear of the old woman, than he began to question his man concerning his recollection of the great mountains that lounged in huge heaps upon the right of them, and in what manner he had observed their station to be in when he had rode from his own hamlet to the inn.

<i>Sturdy</i>, with all the precision he was master of, described them to have appeared much more to the right of the road he had travelled before than they did now, and he readily agreed with <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> that, in consequence of this observation, they must incline more to the left of them, and take their chance for the event, as they had nothing else to steer by.

<SceneAction>They proceeded for a tedious length of time in a course of the most perplexing uncertainties -— one while thinking themselves perfectly right, and the next minute quite as confident they were utterly wrong, and that they had made no progress at all towards the inn. -— Woods, dingles, cross-paths, hills, and dales, continually offering themselves for their choice, they did not know what to do with such a numberless variety of difficulties, which frequently interrupted their view of the great mountains, their original guide, but were obliged to puzzle on at haphazard <Trigger>until</Trigger>, after much fatigue, turning and twisting, great loss of time and ground, the wavering vixen, <i>Fortune</i>, dropped upon them of a sudden, and when they were at their utmost need, in the likeness of a BUTTERWOMAN.

This their deliverer from perplexity and confusion, was coming down a narrow lane within thirty yards of the very road they had lost, and was driving an <i>ass</i> before her, with panniers upon its back stuffed with butter, eggs, and other small wares, that she was conveying to a market, for the morrow, ten miles, she said, beyond the Inn they were going to. They would, in all probability, have crossed the road they wanted to find, from <i>Sturdy</i>'s imperfect knowledge of it, and from their falling in with it at the time both him and his master were impressed with a strong conviction they were by no means near it, had it not been for the <i>butterwoman</i>. So much, indeed, had <i>Sturdy</i>'s mind been all along distressed at his losing the road at all, that at first he could hardly believe their information; -— however, after going into it, and looking about him, and recollecting himself a little, he discovered sufficient tokens to satisfy him and his matter that their intelligence was good. They were, therefore, exceedingly pleased with the <i>butterwoman</i>, and as they had not eaten or drank during the course of so long and tiresome a walk, the <i>butterwoman</i> and her <i>ass</i> were invited to a repast with them under a hedge, which Thomas produced out of his wallet for his master, himself, and the <i>butterwoman</i>, and providence did the same for the <i>ass</i>, in a plentiful bank of thistles by their side; while a nice spring of clear water dropped down a little precipice, ready to dilute, in a tin can, some chearful and reviving spirits which <i>Thomas</i> poured out of a small bottle in just proportions, to warm the hearts of this most happy and congenial party.

It may, probably, be necessary here to mention, as an apology for the very particular account we have given of <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i>'s</AuthorWe> difficulties, in tracing his way towards the public scenes of life, which constituted the motive for his rambling from his native hamlet, that these troubles and embarrassments, as above described, together with the public haunts of men lying so far from his retirement, and the way to them being through such an untrodden maze, afford another striking reason why a young gentleman of his fortune, but so confined as he had been all his days by the dotage of his parents, had not been able to take an opportunity before the present aera of seeing mankind, and that, of course, he must now be, altogether, looked upon, sitting as he is under a hedge, with his man <i>Sturdy</i> and the <i>butterwoman</i>, as an utter stranger to, and quite a novice in the ways of the WORLD.

<Reader>The prying peruser of this pleasant story</Reader> having taken the above occasional crust, to cure him of any gnawings or sicknesses upon his stomach, with which he might be plagued after so long a walk, and <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i>'s</AuthorWe> and <i>heroines</i> (for the <i>ass</i> was of the feminine gender) having finished their slight repast under the hedge for the very same purpose, it is meet that <AuthorWe>we</AuthorWe> return to them immediately, or <i>Sturdy</i> will never have done with his over-civilities to his master, to make him amends for the mistake he had committed about the plaguy road.

This honest fellow had been so excessively abashed and confounded at his missing the way, and thereby losing, perhaps, the future confidence of his master, that he lost all his usual flow of good humour while he was with <i>Goody Gadfly</i>, and had not a word to say to her but what was rather peevish than kind -— and his fighting her <i>cock</i> was more the effect of ill-temper than pleasantry; but the application of a little cold neat's tongue to his stomach, and the operation of a small can full of reanimating fire upon his spirits, together with the countenance of his master, which he narrowly watched, becoming, through the same means, quite chearful and serene, he soon was wound up to his original tone of vivacity, was all assiduity and eagerness to please, but exceedingly glad, at the same time, that the <i>butterwoman</i> had taken the direction of the road to the inn entirely out of his hands, for the future, in which he had been, for the past, so very unfortunate.

Every thing being adjusted respecting the <i>butterwoman</i>'s affairs, and <i>Sturdy</i>'s wallet, after their entertainment under the hedge, the party proceeded in rural simplicity along the lanes, until they arrived at a sudden inclination of the road to the left, when it so happened, that the girths which were intended to secure the panniers upon the <i>ass</i>'s back, broke and caused a delay.

<i>Philo</i>, whose mind was now engaged in reflexions upon a more cultivated and inhabited country than that which he had past, eagerly desired the woman to direct him to a small church he saw at the distance of about a mile and a half before him, if they were to go by it, and ordered his man to stay and assist her in repairing her damages.

There was a fine range of meadowland that ran in an easy serpentine course to the church, and the <i>butterwoman</i> pointed out to <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> a footpath through the same, which he could not miss, and which, she said, was nearer than the horse road, and that she should join him at the church, for it was close to their road to the inn.

<i>Philo</i>, thus satisfied, walked gently over the enamelled ground. He was delighted with the gay assemblage of every species of wild spring flowers that decorated the plain; he was glad to see some dawnings of the accomplishment of his design, in many spacious fields of tillage, and some respectable farrm-houses which he beheld at a distance; he, vauntingly, said to himself, <MonologueThought>all my embarrassments are at an end -— I shall soon be ushered into the company of innumerable mortals, like myself, possessed of innocence, and the most refined sensibility, and I shall experience, in a general society of thousands, the heavenly intercourse of friendship, harmony, and all the tender feelings of humanity, which has hitherto been confined only to my friend the <i>parson</i>, and my late and beloved parents.</MonologueThought> He was thus proceeding with his sublime notions of his fellow creatures, when he was suddenly stopped in his enchanting career by an ANGLER, whom he found <i>torturing</i> a poor worm upon a hook, with all the composure of a cook <i>flaying</i> live eels.

The rivulet, upon the bank of which the <i>angler</i> was standing, seemed to run rapidly by him, and to hide its head among the sedges and overhanging projections below him, as though it were sensible, and ashamed of his barbarity.

The gentle and humane heart of <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> was exceedingly hurt at the writhings, twistings, and apparent agonies of the defenceless worm, and he could not help addressing its wanton and heedless murderer, in a manner the most expressive of his concern and sorrow for the fate of the poor reptile; but such are the savage proceedings that are countenanced and confirmed by the general habits among the sons of men, that the <i>angler</i> looked upon <i>Philo</i>, during his speech, to be the most silly fellow he had ever seen in his life. —- He continued fixing fast upon his hook the little struggling creature, while the following observations upon this <i>vacant butcher</i> were made to him.

<DiaM>"How can you help," <M>exclaimed <i>Philo</i></M>, "feeling in your own bosom the pangs of remorse, while the pressure of your fingers upon that worm must intimate to your nerves, that it is as sensible of the pain you give it with your hook, as you yourself would experience upon the rack? -— I grant you that the great God that made us, and sent us into this world, seems, from the redundancy of the animals of all sorts with which he has overstocked the earth, to intimate to the lord of this creation, MAN, that he might destroy them at his descretion, but, at the same time, it manifestly appears from the delicate construction of all bodies that contain life and animation, that death is a throe that ought to excite compassion among the living, and that its fatal stroke should never be given to the most insignificant animal, but with the tender efforts of quickness and dispatch; then how can you, you most ruthless man as you are, merely through wantonness, plague that poor worm as you do? -— If you want fish for your table, get a net and catch them without violence, and their death will be the same by your hands, as by by hands of him that destined them to die, -— or, if your intention; in pulling out of the water the pretty creatures, be pastime, fix to the end of your line an imitation of a fly -— a thing I have observed made of the feather of a fowl, and by this nice deceit the simple freckled fools will snap at your bait upon the surface of the brook, and be taken without any unnecessary symptoms of barbarity in their destroyer."</DiaM>

At the close of this tender expostulation, <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> found, to his utter astonishment and mortification, that the <i>angler</i> having placed to his mind the poor worm upon his hook, and which discovered to the eye of pity all the convulsive motions of a tortured criminal, he plunged it into the rivulet with the same heedless inattention to the pain he inflicted upon his bait, as he did to the pathetic remonstrance of his adviser, and looking steadfastly upon his cork, he exhibited no other signs upon the occasion but the true dreaming insensibility of his tribe.

This was the first time in his life that <i>Philo</i> found his words of no effect, and that he was not listened to and admired: he turned away from the angler quite disconcerted and abashed, and walked along the bank of the brook and pondered. -— He had frequently seen the boys and rustics of his hamlet catching the small fry, and exercising some marks of cruelty upon their baits; but these simpletons always paid the strictest attention to his admonitions, and desisted from their foolery upon the least token of his disapprobation of their conduct;, but a settled deliberate <i>plague</i> to the reptile race he had never met with before, and this circumstance, as it was the first, it was a great check to his expectations, and staggered his faith, in some degree, with regard to the high opinion he had formed to himself of the humankind. -— He had often helped the <i>parson</i> and <i>Sturdy</i> to throw the net for the dappled inhabitants of the pond -— but as he looked upon it, that the almighty disposer of all things had destined these creatures, with others of the animal species, for the food of man, he thought it is duty, only, not to exercise any cruelties upon them, more than he could avoid, in their dissolution. -— He had sometimes attended the parson, who was a curious maker of flies (an art he had learnt at college) and was much pleased with his imitations of the different sorts of them, for the uses of the different times of the spring and summer. -— He thought there was something adroit and clever in this practice, and more especially in the delicate and masterly manner in which the parson threw his deceitful bait upon the trout-brook. -— He was pleased with the activity of this mode of fishing, and his extreme sensibility was never hurt to any extraordinary degree, when the speckled, flouncing frighted captive, was drawn, at last, breathless to the edge of the water, and taken with only a small and almost imperceptible hook, perforating its lip.

<i>Philo</i> was just recovering from his meditations upon these matters, when the laughing <i>Sturdy</i> joined him. -— He perceived that <i>Thomas</i> had got some fresh conceit in his head, and he likened to his man with his usual condescension,, while he informed his master of the following adventure.

Thomas having done every thing in his power for the benefit of the <i>butterwoman</i>, in fastening her girths, in talking to her, of course, in helping her upon the back of her <i>ass</i>, and in advising her to whip the little strong animal on that she might get to the church as soon as himself, took the "foot-path way" over the meadows, and ran after his master as fast as his great diligence and attention prompted him along. -— He stopped to take a little breath by the side of the <i>angler</i>, and as <i>Thomas</i>, in the most active part of his concerns, had a mighty knack at the inspection of every thing that was going forwards about him, he could not help taking a hasty survey of what the man by the brook was doing. —- He found that the <i>angler</i> had catched a fish that had gorged his hook, and that the unfeeling monster was tearing it out of the body of the poor victim, with no other tokens in his gesticulations, but a strong anxiety lest he should spoil his hook, or break his line, and lose thereby the immediate opportunity of committing any more of the crimes of the <i>fisherman</i>. -— <i>Sturdy</i> no sooner saw what the <i>angler</i> was about, than he, in great wrath, asked him if he did not think himself a hard-hearted rogue, for catching poor fish in that clumsy way, and pulling their guts out while they were alive, when he might take them with a net or a sham fly without hurting them at all? -— To which the <i>angler</i>, with the genuine coolness of a man used to the sober amusement of commiting deliberate murder, replied -— <DiaQ>"Do not you, fellow, belong to the <i>fool</i> that is gone before you?"</DiaQ> -— <DiaM>"<i>Yes</i>," <M>said <i>Sturdy</i></M>, "<i>I do</i>" -— <M>and, with a sudden spring, he tossed the <i>angler</i> plump into the brook, and left him to get out of it at his leisure</M>.</DiaM>

As soon as <i>Thomas</i> had finished his story, and embellished it properly with his description of the angler plunging in the water like a hog in distress, his master could not help discovering such signs of his approbation as satisfied <i>Sturdy</i> he had not done much amiss in throwing the <i>worm-teaser</i> into the rivulet; but, nevertheless, the gentle <i>Philo</i> warned his man against any hostile proceedings for the future, and they joined the <i>butterwoman</i>, who was waiting for them at the church, and accomplished the remainder of their walk to the inn, without meeting with any farther obstructions or incidents worthy notice on their way</SceneAction>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. VII.</ChapMarker>

<ChapTitle>CHARACTER OF A COUNTRY SQUIRE, AND A CURATE.</ChapTitle>

<SceneQuasi>THERE was a novelty in the appearance of <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> and his <i>suite</i>, on his approach to the inn, that struck the people in the house and in the yard exceedingly. -— They could not conceive, at first sight, what manner of a young man he was, and from whence he had started, with a man with a wallet upon his back, and a woman and an ass at her heels. They were still more astonished at <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> and his retinue, from his particular attention to his followers, and, especially, from his solicitude for the accommodation of the woman. -— This last circumstance, which was nothing more than the natural effect of his gratitude for the services she had wrought in his favour, as his conductress upon the road, was construed by the spectators into a thousand different shapes, all tending to the disadvantage of our <i>rambler</i>; and he, and his man <i>Sturdy</i>, with the <i>butterwoman</i> by their side, were followed into one of the outer rooms of the inn by the curious eyes, and the notable animadversions, of the most contemptible of all speculators -— the <i>loungers</i> in the barn and in the yard of a public house.

The <i>hostess</i>, who was a jolly handsome discerning woman, and a widow, being accosted, on all sides, as well by the <i>squire</i>, the <i>curate</i>, and the <i>traveller</i>, is by the <i>exciseman</i>, and the <i>parish clerk</i>, to go into this extraordinary party, and bring out what intelligence she could gather concerning them and their affairs, no sooner entered the room (for she had been too busy to mind them before) than she recognized <i>Sturdy</i> and the family he belonged to, and was quite pleased when she was informed by him, that <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> was his young master <i>Philo</i>, going upon a ramble for his amusement, that they should have been lost upon the road, had not they accidentally met with the woman before her, and that his master desired she might have something good to eat and drink before she proceeded farther upon her own business. -— The good-natured <i>hostess</i> recollected the <i>butterwoman</i> also, and knew her to be (though a young woman) the mother of many children, and a very notable, pains-taking, modest creature. —- She ushered <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> into the best room of her house, and received his commands for his dinner with the marks of the greatest attention and cordiality. -— She sent some good things to <i>Sturdy</i>, for the immediate accommodation of himself and the <i>butterwoman</i>, and returned into the bar, and diverted herself at the expence of the wiseacres, her gill-drinkers, who had been so wantonly stupid, as to mistake a simple young country gentleman and his man, with a poor honest woman, a vender of butter and small wares, for a set of wild and unchaste contemners of the laws of order, decency, and decorum.</SceneQuasi>

<i>Philo</i>, in consequence of the civility of his <i>hostess</i>, and the readiness with which she complied with his wishes, in taking immediate care of his followers, felt himself exceedingly elated. -— All the transporting ideas of the pleasures he should receive in society rushed into his mind, and afforded him a wonderful commixture of joy, impatience, hope, and anxiety, during the interval between the time his <i>hostess</i> left him to his own meditations, and his dinner. -— He had seen the faces of mirth and good-humour as he entered the inn with his party, and had attributed the smiling countenances of the people about him to the charming motives of a general gladness of heart at his arrival, and an index of their warmest wishes for his company. —- He did not know how to introduce himself to the people; he continued a long while in great expectation that they would wait upon him -— but to no effect -— nobody came near him, until the waiter with the tablecloth, and the landlady with the dinner, supplied his very good appetite with the most substantial of all arguments, after his bodily fatigues, to chase away, for the present, all the perturbations of his mind.

<Exclamation>How different were the thoughts of <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe>, and the notions he had formed to himself of the spectators, who had beheld the simple manner in which he had sprung out of his solitude, from what had been really passing in the minds of his observers, and their comments upon him and his affairs! -— How strangely would the real knowledge of his situation, and the wicked suggestions of the people, have operated upon the innocent mind and the delicate feelings of <i>Philo</i>! -— How must he have shuddered at the thought of his being looked upon, on his first advance in life, as a stroller, and a vagaband, and an impure associate with a <i>fellow</i>, and a <i>trull</i>! And how might it have fared with him and his concerns, if <i>Sturdy</i> had not been known by the hostess for a faithful servant in his family, and the <i>butterwoman</i> for a modest industrious creature!</Exclamation> -— Surely he must have met with many troublesome scoffs and taunts from the witcrackers; and if the good lady of the house had been of an over-righteous cast, he must have stood the terrible storm of her flounces and bounces at him, for his daring to take <CharacterDiction>such a trollop</CharacterDiction>, as she would have called the woman, into any of her apartments. -- But providence, and his good fortune, in the person of his kind hostess, ordered it otherwise for <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe>, and he is yet to learn, what he has by no means been acquainted with, viz. that ridiculous readiness with which all degrees of people, but especially <i>idle</i> people, run into censure; and how much more pleasant a thing it would have been to the immediate feelings of the speculators upon him, on his entrance into the inn, if their vicious conjectures had proved <i>right</i>, than to be directly obliged to give up their claim to sagacity, and undergo the mortification of being catched in a palpable and shameful error of judgment.

The <i>squire</i>, the <i>curate</i>, and the <i>traveller</i>, who were among the foremost to condemn <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe>, on his approach to the inn, as an abandoned young fellow, instead of his being proved, by the very satisfactory account which the hostess had given of him, to be one of the most virtuous youths of the age, were now exceedingly desirous to see such an extraordinary personage, and agreed to stay and dine at the family table, and afterwards, to send their compliments to him, as a stranger, and to denote to him that they would be glad to drink a <i>bottle</i> with him.

The <i>squire</i> was a hearty country gentleman of fortune in the neighbourhood, who kept a pack of hounds and a plentiful table; who drank <i>stingo</i> and smoked tobacco, and one that lived in the old English style of unpolished, but real hospitality.

It being now summer, and the animating sports of the field at an end, he was, as the common saying is, like a fish out of water, and idled his time away in the morning with the <i>curate</i>, either in dreaming walks about his grounds, or in looking to the breed of his pack, or, more frequently, in lounging at the inn, and taking a gill or two of <i>wine</i> in the bar to <i>whet</i> his appetite for his dinner, and in seeing how the world wagged among the travellers upon the road.

The <i>curate</i> supplied the place of a parson who did not reside at this living, which consisted of a large and scattered parish of inhabitants; and being a rosy, complying, good-tempered man, he was the constant companion of the <i>squire</i>. -— He lived <i>luxuriously</i> with the <i>squire</i>, and preached <i>temperance</i> to his flock. 

The <i>traveller</i> a master of drapery, and going on his journey through the same town the <i>butterwoman</i> was setting our for, after her dining with <i>Sturdy</i>; but recollecting, from his accidentally speaking to her in the yard, that the morrow was a market day there, he excused himself from staying to dine at the inn, as he found it would occasion a delay in his business, which if he did not execute that evening among the tradesmen of the town, they would be too much engaged in their shops on the morrow, to have any thing to say to him. -- He therefore ordered out his bags and his nag, and trotted away about his business.

The <i>squire</i> and the <i>curate</i> being thus left to themselves, sauntered about till the household dinner was ready -— they had no sooner dispatched their share of it, than they desired the <i>hostess</i> to acquaint <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe>, who had by this time finished his own meal, and who was quite ready for such a message, that two gentlemen of the country would be glad to drink a <i>bottle</i> with him, if he chose to admit of their company. -— <i>Philo</i> expressed himself extremely happy with their desire, for it was the very thing he had been waiting for; and his ardour upon the occasion, as it very much pleased the <i>hostess</i>, was not lost in her manner of delivering his answer to the party.

<i>Philo</i>, though he had lived a temperate life, in general, with his parents, and his friend, the parson, yet he was no milksop. He could drink his <i>bottle</i>, occasionally, and oftentimes in his convivial hours at home, he had smoked his pipe with the <i>parson</i> (an art which the <i>parson</i> had learnt at college) and had joined his old father, who was no despiser of the good things the Lord had blessed him with, in an ancient ditty to the praise of <i>Bacchus</i> and jolly doings, until he, as well as the whole family, were in a state of high merriment, little short of the sad crime of inebriation.

Thus <AuthorWe>our <i>hero</i></AuthorWe> was in some sort prepared for the attack which was meditated against him; and if we consider the characters of his approaching visiters, the <i>bottle</i> may safely be supposed to have its due weight, and strength of argument, in their intended enjoyment of his company.
