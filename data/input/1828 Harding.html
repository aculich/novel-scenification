<ChapMarker>CHAP. I.</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia><Dia>"I have been watching you for an hour, Georgette, and all that time you have been working most indefatigably on a pair of black silk gloves; now do, in the name of common sense, tell me what you are doing to them?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Mending them," <M>replied Georgette, without raising her eyes, or moving a muscle.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Mending them!" <M>exclaimed Percival, with every feature of his fine face full of expression;</M> "and is time no better worth than to waste it by poring over an old pair of gloves by the hour?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Not to me."</Dia>

<Dia>"Not to you, Georgette! -— to whom then should it be? A young creature like you should find every moment full of enjoyment: if all is not hope and expectation now, when shall it be?"</Dia>

<DiaM><i>"Never!"</i> <M>emphatically replied Georgette, as the door opening,</M></DiaM> a beautiful girl, decked in all the <DoxaQuotes>"trim and gear of fashion,"</DoxaQuotes> entered, exclaiming — <DiaQ>"What a provoking creature you are, Percival! I have been seeking you all over the house. Who could have fancied you had ensconced yourself in this triste abode of dulness?"</DiaQ>

<Dia>"Not you, beautiful Madeline, could you? —- nor have I an idea myself how I came here; but sit down, my sweet cousin, by me; I want to ask you —--"</Dia>

<Dia>"Any thing, and any where but here, Percival; this is the very cave of Trophoius, and you being the presiding goddess of the cave; so come along from hence."</Dia>

<Dia>"Nay, Madeline, my question must be answered here, in this very cave. Come, sit down and tell me, what may be the value of a pair of black silk gloves, new and good?"</Dia>

<Dia>"What! black silk gloves! how can I possibly tell you any thing about such things?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Well then, if you cannot, I must apply to Georgette. —- Tell me, you little miracle of industry, what are those gloves worth when quite new?"</Dia>

Georgette did not reply.

Percival repeated his question, adding —- <DiaQ>"I want to ascertain what you will earn by such close application to a disgusting employ."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Oh, don't ask her any thing!" <M>interrupted Madeline;</M> "she has no idea what you mean, poor thing. You see she must have some employ to keep her out of mischief, so Williams employs her in doing such little matters as this; though, Heaven knows, who among the people will ever wear a mended glove, I am sure I cannot conceive."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Do you know, Georgette?" <M>asked Percival.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes," <M>replied she, in a low firm voice.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Who, Georgette?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Georgette Dal Castro."</Dia>

<Dia>"Good Heavens, Georgette!"</Dia>

<DiaM>"What stuff!" <M>exclaimed Madeline.</M> "Do, Percival, come away; I declare I never heard any thing so ridiculous! I am quite ashamed of such low paltry nonsense!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But, Georgette," <M>resumed the immovable Percival,</M> "do you really mean what you say? are you indeed to wear these rags?" <M>holding up one with marked contempt.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"There are three pair; if I mend them all <i>neatly</i>, Williams will sell two pairs, and I shall be allowed to wear the worst —- that is, when I go to church, and on high occasions; generally I must do as now —- without any."</Dia>

<DiaM>"By Heavens! you shall never do that!" <M>exclaimed Percival, as, throwing the black heap into the fire, he, with the poker, rammed the burning coals down on them; then throwing three guineas on the table</M> —- "There !" <M>cried he</M>; "give William two of those pieces for her share of the rags, and with the other get yourself decent gloves; and now, poor dear Georgette, go and enjoy thyself as becomes thy age and station; and remember, I must have a Spanish song in the drawing-room this evening."</DiaM>

For one moment a strong expression of contempt curled her short upper lip, and her large black eyes blazed scornfully, as raising them to those of Percival, she repeated, pushing back the money —- <DiaQ>"'Enjoy!' -— 'becomes my age and station!' —- 'song!' —- oh, yes! —- take back your gold —- I am no pauper!"</DiaQ>

Percival started; but the vision was gone —- and the same marbled features, the same still pale girl, stood before him.

<DiaM>"There!" <M>cried Madeline, triumphantly.</M> "Now, Percival, you see her airs —- you are witness to her temper; can any thing be more ungrateful or insolent? I am sure I wonder mamma has any patience with her, or that she keeps her at all, for I believe she does not know what graditude or affection means. You will perhaps prevail on yourself to leave her now."</DiaM>

At this moment a frightfully ugly brown dog pushed its rough head from a cupboard, and looking fearfully round, would have withdrawn; but a sign from Georgette gave it encouragement, and limping across the room, the creature fawned on its mistress, who returned its caresses, with a fondness that showed she knew at least what affection meant.

Madeline laughed loudly and scornfully — <DiaM>"Pretty innocent! what a lovely pet she has chosen!" <M>cried she.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Surely, Georgette, you do not <i>love</i> that ugly beast!" <M>exclaimed Percival.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"She is lame," <M>replied Georgette, still stroking its rough head.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Lame; ay, so are a dozen other poor animals, that nobody cares for —- you cannot love her for that."</Dia>

<DiaM>"She is old and deserted," <M>returned Georgette, as she again fondled her.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"'Old and deserted,' that she is; do, pray, send her to the kennel."</Dia>

<DiaM>"She is ugly," <M>and Georgette kissed her rough head.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Ugly! upon my honour, she is! now, my dear Georgette, allow me to get the creature hung; lame, old, deserted, and ugly, what value can you place on her?"</Dia>

Once more Georgette raised her large black eyes; but this time their fire was quenched in tears; passionately throwing her arms around the old dog, she cried — <DiaQ>"She loves me!"</DiaQ> in tones that thrilled through the warmed heart of Percival, tingled on his ears, and made him internally swear to love her too, and to be loved by her.

The moment of excitement passed, and by Georgette appeared to be forgotten. Donna was quietly laid beneath the table. From a trunk that stood by its side, she drew forth a laboriously-worked flounce, but partly finished, and again resumed her needle, with unwearied industry, and apparent unconcern.

<Dia>"Now, my gallant knight-errant, that you see this damsel more worthily employed than in repairing gloves, perhaps you will bestow some attention on the humble Madeline, who has so long, and so patiently waited your pleasure?"</Dia>

<Dia>"What do you want, my fair Madeline? And why quarrel with this room? It is the only quiet place in or about Cotswold Park."</Dia>

<Dia>"Nay, Percival, that is very unkind of you. I wanted you to give me your opinion of a little sketch I have been taking from the dell below, and there is no moving you from this frightful room, or from Georgette, or from the dog, or something."</Dia>

<Dia>"From all, my dear; they are all infinitely interesting to me; so are you, and your sketches; and, if you will allow me to send tor the drawing, I dare say Georgette will assist you with her observations."</Dia>

<Dia>"Lord, Percival, what should Georgette know of drawing? It is quite ridiculous!"</Dia>

<Dia>"Come, come, Madeline, I know your perspective is usually faulty; let us hear what Georgette says to it."</Dia>

A servant answered the bell, not a little astonished at receiving a summons from that room.

<Dia>"Where shall he find the sketch, Madeline?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Such nonsense!" <M>replied she, spitefully.</M> "I cannot direct John. If it must come here, Georgette must fetch it."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Georgette shall do no such thing. John brings it, or you lose my valuable remarks, as well as those of your friend; unless indeed you fear to trust John, then you can fetch it yourself."</Dia>

Though stung with rage, Madeline could not resist the easy assurance of her handsome cousin, so gave the servant directions where to find the sketch-book, who soon returned with the collection of distorted objects.

<DiaM>"This," <M>cried Madeline, hastily turning the leaves over,</M> "is the one on which I wish your opinion. Are not those trees something too high, and those too near? This water is certainly beautiful."</DiaM>

<Dia>"I dare say it is; fair Madeline; but it would be much improved by your writing on it '<i>this is water</i>.' The trees certainly are of the <i>Glumdaldich order</i>."</Dia>

<Dia>"Horrid! Percival, I declare you are insufferable! Give me my book. You were not always so rude!"</Dia>

<Dia>"Nay, my dear, I have not done with it. What do you think of this water, Georgette?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Nothing."</Dia>

<Dia>"No, to be sure, because you have not looked at it. Now do examine it, and then tell me if you do not think it more like a ploughed field than water."</Dia>

<Dia>"I never think."</Dia>

<Dia>"You mean to say you never give an opinion; but, Georgette, you are old enough to give an opinion and shall no longer be kept under by any one."</Dia>

<Dia>"Upon my word, Percival, Georgette should feel flattered by your knight-errantry; and mamma will doubtless thank you for teaching her to feel dissatisfied; but I doubt if all this will improve her situation; indeed I don't know that she has any thing to complain of; have you, Georgette?"</Dia>

Georgette continued silent.

<Dia>"To complain of! Certainly not, Madeline. Who can complain, under the magnificent roof of the splendid earl and countess of Caerphillon, whose brilliant comet-like movements attract the gaze of all the great and little world? Complain of indeed! Can a descendant of the ancient house of Dal Castro complain, while she is allowed the high privilege of sitting in this elegant apartment, and earning for herself a pair of mended black-silk gloves, to wear to church —- loving an ugly dog by stealth —- occupying the lowest seat at the schoolroom table, and sitting an hour silent in the drawing-room unnoticed and unadorned? To be sure not —- the thing is just impossible."</Dia>

<Dia>"Really, Percival, I think you are mad."</Dia>

<Dia>"Not at all, my dear —- never more in my senses."</Dia>

<Dia>"I don't believe it —- I am quite alarmed at you."</Dia>

<Dia>"And do you know, Madeline, alarm is particularly unbecoming to you? Let me advise you to recover your temper —- spirits —- equanimity —- composure. What shall I call it?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Call it any thing you please, Percival, if it is to oblige Georgette; you are become so suddenly disagreeable, why I fancy the '<i>descendent of the ancient house of Dal Castro</i>' will find she has little to thank you for."</Dia>

<Dia>"I should be sorry for that; for, do you know, Madeline, it strikes me she has but little to thank some of you for, beyond the honour of contributing to your handsome ornaments, by her industry. Nay, don't look cross, my pretty Madge; but help my stupidity, by telling me what this is intended for. Here are flowers and trees, and birds and bats, and cats and rats, and dogs and frogs, and fishes and flies, and ——"</Dia>

<DiaM>"And nothing at all!" <M>cried Madeline, throwing her pocket handkerchief over the book.</M> "You are absolutely grown malicious. If this is all young men gain by going to college and the Continent, they had better remain at home."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Ay, so they had indeed, my dear! but this is not half they learn; you have yet to be surprised by the number and variety

of my college and continental acquirements; among them is a determination to have my questions answered; so now tell me, why is this slight sketch, in which there is both taste and spirit, left unfinished?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh, that -- I did not do it; Miss Roubell, or —- I don't recollect who did it."</Dia>

<Dia>"Who did it, Georgette?"</Dia>

<Dia>"I did."</Dia>

<DiaM>"You did!" <M>exclaimed Madeline</M>; "why I did not know you had ever learnt to draw."</DiaM>

<Dia>"I never did."</Dia>

<Dia>"How then can you say you did this?"</Dia>

<Dia>"The little that is done to that, you saw me do."</Dia>

<Dia>"Did I? well, I had forgotten it. I thought either Miss Roubell or Edith, only Edith is so stupid."</Dia>

<Dia>"Edith stupid! poor Edith! But, Georgette, you have a taste for drawing; you and I will sketch some of the beautiful scenery round this place: I should like though to see a little more done to this; can you fill it up from memory?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Yes, very welL."</Dia>

<Dia>"Where is the scene?"</Dia>

<Dia>"In Spain."</Dia>

<Dia>"I thought so."</Dia>

<Dia>"Nonsense, Percival! Georgette will finish it some other time; I want you just now to assist me with this landscape from the dell."</Dia>

<Dia>"Well, Madeline, with all my heart; in the first place, I propose that we write under it —- <i>This is a landscape from the dell</i>, to prevent its being mistaken for a scene from Chaos."</Dia>

<Dia>"Saucy creature! because you are clever, we are all to be artists."</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh no; it is the attempt at being what Nature never designed you for, that I quarrel at —- you, without the least idea of distance, keeping, proportion, or colouring, will be an artist -- Edith, with an ear than can scarcely distinguish between a kettledrum and a flute, must be a musician forsooth."</Dia>

<Dia>"Really, Percival, we are greatly obliged to you."</Dia>

<Dia>"You ought to be, for I have rubbed out this hideous scratch, or nearly so. To which of the others shall I perform the same kind office?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh, you cruel wretch! —- What shall I do! Do you know, I had taken that at papa's particular request, who will be vexed, and perhaps angry with me: I promised to give it him to-morrow, and reckoned greatly on your assistance."</Dia>

<Dia>"It is the only way which I could assist you, Madeline. The earl should know you <i>cannot draw</i>; leave it to me —- I'll tell him."</Dia>

<Dia>"Not for the world! it would vex him so."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Is it for the earl, or for Mountstewart, you want it?" <M>asked Georgette.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"On my honour, Georgette, for the earl, and him alone."</Dia>

Georgette, without speaking, took up the pencil, and in ten minutes, a lively landscape sketch, in just proportions and faithful likeness, represented the desired spot.

<Dia>"Thank you, Georgette; you realty are very kind sometimes: depend on it, I wont say a word about who did it for me."</Dia>

<Dia>"No; but you will spoil it in the finishing —- you cannot help it."</Dia>

<Dia>"If you think so, Percival, you had better finish it yourself; I know you have a good opinion of your own pencil."</Dia>

<Dia>"Tolerably so; but I would rather Georgette finished it; any second hand would injure the drawing. How long would it take you to finish it, Georgette?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Merely as a sketch, not more than two hours."</Dia>

<Dia>"Then, in pity to your own work, give it that two hours, and not let Madeline spoil it."</Dia>

<Dia>"Do you wish I should, lady Madeline?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh certainly, certainly! it is a pity <i>I</i> should spoil <i>your</i> work."</Dia>

<Dia>"Indeed it is; but after all, it is more a pity you should condescend to falsehood, and reap laurels you never earned; so if the work is to pass as yours, request a day's grace; and try your luck at the pencil again."</Dia>

<DiaM>"A dangerous experiment," <M>said Georgette, as her black eye glanced over the odd-like groups in the sketch-book </M>: "if you really want it for your papa, give him this, and say nothing about the matter; no one will ever suspect me of doing it."</DiaM>

<Dia>"And for whom, Georgette, are you working all these exquisite flowers —- <QuotedLit>'roses that laugh, and lilies that weep?'</QuotedLit> are these for your own adornment?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Mine, Percival!" <M>and her indignant eye rested for a moment on the rusty black frock, whose scanty dimensions scarcely covered her, though joined and patched in every direction.</M></DiaM>

<Dia>"Oh no, it is for me, and forms part of my dress, for the fancy ball that mamma intends giving before we go."</Dia>

<Dia>"Have you then fixed on your character already?"</Dia>

<Dia>"No; but any character will require a beautiful dress."</Dia>

<Dia>"Not a nun, or a fortune-teller, or a gipsey, or a match-seller, or a -——"</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh, I shall not go in any of those, you may depend on it; I shall be a virgin of the sun, or a Circassian princess, or one of the rosy houris, or a grace, or a goddess, or ———"</Dia>

<Dia>"Or any other magnificent personage that you know nothing about; and so make as great a botch of your acting as of your drawing, notwithstanding your borrowed plumes: fie, fie, Madeline! be honest, and be rational, or I shall certainly cut you. And what character will you personify, Georgette?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Not any."</Dia>

<Dia>"If I am here, you shall make one of the company, I am determined; so determine on your character."</Dia>

<Dia>"Cinderella in her rags, that best suits my wardrobe —- <i>and I hate deceit.</i>"</Dia>

<Dia>"So do I, Georgette; and ingratitude as well. Think how good mamma and papa are to you, and you not a shilling fortune, and belong to nobody knows who; they let you live here, and allow Miss Roubell to educate you, and bring you into the drawing-room."</Dia>

<Dia>"Pray, lady Madeline, do not trouble yourself to enumerate any more of the many favours showered on '<i>nobody knows who,</i>' though she does happen to be the only child of the noble Dal Castro and the lady Flora Alphington, eldest daughter of the eighth earl of Caerphillon."</Dia>

Again the dark eye of Georgette blazed; every feature glowed with animation; her exquisitely formed figure, which not even the ill-made frock could hide, dilated, and a proud look of conscious worth spread over her countenance, from which Madeline shrunk in affright, and on which Percival thought he could have gazed for ever. — <DiaM>"But no matter; this farce must have an end," <M>continued she, in low tones, as, passing her hand before her eyes, she again sunk into littleness, and quietly resumed her drawing.</M></DiaM></SceneDia>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. II.</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia><Dia>"Ha, sir John, your most obedient! How long has Cotswold Park been honoured by your presence? I had not the pleasure of seeing you before."</Dia>

<Dia>"That, most noble Percival, is because you were not in the way when Kenyon and myself arrived two hours since; nor could any body fancy what was become of you."</Dia>

<Dia>"Kenyon -— is he here? That's famous! Now then, granger, partridge, moor-hen, black-cock, pheasant, woodcock, snipe, and every thing claiming kindred with game, beware! for Kenyon -— Kenyon himself is on the ground, and his single, double, and treble-barrelled guns all in high order."</Dia>

<DiaM>"And he himself keen for sport, but keener still to shake hands with his friend, the honourable Percival Alphington!" <M>exclaimed Kenyon, just then entering the drawing-room</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ha! -— how do? -— how do?" <M>squeaked little lord Alphington, a pale-faced. thin, white headed, would-be man. with a most unfortunately feminine aspect, figure, and voice, that, at twenty, gave him the appearance of a sickly girl of fourteen, which he vainly strove to hide, under the assumption of premature dandyism, and an affectation of manliness.</M> "Glad to see ye, sir John, egad! Well, Kenyon, my fine fellow! what horses, what dogs, guns, &c, &c, &c. have ye brought? Fine weather this for sport. To-morrow is the day. I mean to be out betimes -— up with the sun -— that's the go, my boy!"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Be sure you keep out of the way of danger, Alphington, or sure as fate, you are shot for a wild duck."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Humph!" <M>cried Alphington; but <ArrivalDeparture>the entrance of other company</ArrivalDeparture> recalled the little beau's smiles.</M> -— "Hey, what, Catharine Gresham! -— the lovely, the majestic, the glorious Catharine, the only true Lancashire witch of witches! You in the house, Catharine, and I not to know it -— not to feel my destiny so near me!"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Still the same rattling Percival -— still the same good-natured, thoughtless being we left at Paris. Oxford has not changed you, Percival."</Dia>

<Dia>"Changed me, Catharine! Not where you are concerned, most truly: but, heigh-ho! yes, 'tis very true, I have the added weight of seven long months on my head since then, with the finishing stroke of alma mater to boot; but there now, seated by you, time, and all its concomitants, are forgotten."</Dia>

<Dia>"I have much to tell you, Percival, and much to hear; but this is not the time: one question only; have you heard from your sister?"</Dia>

<Dia>"From Maria once only: she has made her own election; and you nor I shall never hear her complain."</Dia>

<Dia>"She has no cause of complaint, Percival; married to the man she dotes on, whose whole soul is devoted to her, how can she be sensible to distance, privation, or fatigue?"</Dia>

<Dia>"That is a question you ladies must settle; I know nothing about it. But I cannot help fancying, that whenever I have a wife, she will expect me to shield her from all these difficulties, or else the dear creature will think she has cause of complaint. <i>Mais tenez vous, voila madame la comtesse</i>."</Dia>

Leaning on the arm of an exquisite of the first order, perfumed, curled, ringed, and pinked out in the highest cut of modish bedizenment, the countess of Caerphillon, surrounded with almost regal state, <ArrivalDeparture>entered her splendid drawing-room</ArrivalDeparture>, with majestic grandeur, not unworthy a queen, and was immediately followed by the earl, on whose arm hung his eldest daughter, the beautiful lady Madeline. The countess made her way to the top of the room, graciously smiling and bowing as she passed along; her splendid attire, her towering height, commanding appearance, and dignity of carriage, all proclaiming her superiority.

The earl led his daughter to a seat, by the side of her mother, and then, advancing to the centre of the room, received his numerous guests with dignified but unostentatious politeness. <DiaM>"How extremely beautiful my aunt is!" <M>said Catharine Gresham</M>; "she puts me out of conceit with all the young beauties, their girlishness is so very inferior to the mature graces of her ladyship."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Ay, Minerva has her charms, but, Catharine, it is Venus that fascinates."</Dia>

<DiaM>"What nonsense are you talking to this young lady, about Minerva, and Venus, and such like heathenish fancies?" <M>asked a little plain old man, standing stiff and erect before them.</M> "Is it not lamentable, that truth will not please as well as falsehood? say to her -- 'Catharine, you are to-day a beautiful piece of dying mortality; but that beauty will fade, the fullness of your figure will shrink away, your auburn hair will turn grey and fall off, and ---"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And then you must get a wig, false teeth, rouge well, and pad with judgment," <M>interrupted Percival, in a tone of ridiculous mock gravity</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Young gentlemen," <M>returned the little old man</M>, "my observations deserve your attention; they are truths -— solemn truths; and truth, though not palatable, is salutary."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Ay, dear sir, so is a dose of salts; but pray spare us the one and the other just now."</Dia>

<Dia>"Ah, Percival! what, not a word for an old friend?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Miss Gresham! this is indeed an unexpected pleasure; I am beyond measure delighted to see you looking so charmingly."</Dia>

<Dia>"Ay, ay, there it goes -— all emptiness and falsehood: this will please the fools, tickle their ears, lull their senses, and blind them to the gulf that gapes to devour them; poor things! poor things!"</Dia>

<Dia>"Pray, Alphington, can you tell in what state the moon is? Your old friend Lloyd seems to be even particularly overclouded this morning."</Dia>

<Dia>"Really, my dear Miss Ramsay, I cannot inform you, that's poz; but, 'pon my honour, I haven't an idea."</Dia>

<Dia>"That's clear enough."</Dia>

<Dia>"Hey, what? did you honour me by speaking, Miss Ramsay? but as I was observing, I cannot conceive --"</Dia>

<Dia>"Pity you should."</Dia>

<Dia>"You think I should? well, hang me --"</Dia>

"With all my heart.

<Dia>"If I can fancy why the earl keeps such an old bore about the house."</Dia>

<Dia>"I dare say not."</Dia>

<Dia>"Not I; but poz it grows too bad; the animal must be confined to his room, or sent off -— I shall make a point of it -— the creature grows horrific -— don't you think so?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Does he terrify your lordship? I thought his day of power had passed away."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Terrify me! of course not -— the thing is ridiculous; it is you, ladies, I fear for: but you must have your joke, Miss Ramsay;" <M>and Alphington passed on</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Mountstewart still in high favour here?" <M>said sir John to his friend captain Thornhill</M>; "how the deuce such a complete pouncet-box, such a dandyfied mixture of French foppery, Italian art, German dulness, and English conceit, ever found the means of winding itself into the good graces -— nay, apparently, into the confidence of such persons as the earl and countess of Caerphillon, surpasses all my ingenuity to discover."</DiaM>

<Dia>"How? why the thing is easy enough to discover -— a delicate portion of his French foppery, a <i>quantum sufficit</i> of Italian art, now and then a convenient fit of German dulness, never forgetting his English conceit, well followed up by cameos, intaglios, unique specimens of rare sculpture, cabinet pictures from the first masters, a plentiful portion of flattery, with constant attention and deference -— all this, sir John, all this will bend even the stately oak of Caerphillon."</Dia>

<Dia>"And the reward of all this slavery -- this life of art and acting --"</Dia>

<Dia>"Is, I think, self-evident."</Dia>

<Dia>"What do you mean? Madeline, I know, is destined for her cousin Percival."</Dia>

<Dia>"But how many of these human destinies fail? Percival is not a temper to be controlled; the very attempt would make him clap his wings, and crow his triumphant liberty; and in the mean time, Mountstewart enjoys certain advantages."</Dia>

<Dia>"What are they?"</Dia>

<Dia>"An easy entrance into a certain set -— the very <i>élite du monde</i>."</Dia>

<Dia>"His birth entitles him to that -— he has blood."</Dia>

<Dia>"But the smiles of the countess puts him years in advance: again, a constant seat at the magnificent table of the earl, and a seat at the left hand of the countess in her carriage, in her box at the opera, in her box at the theatres, and in her drawing-room."</Dia>

<Dia>"Pooh, pooh! all this may be of consequence to a <i>parvenue</i> manufacturer, or to a fellow starving on his commission; but to a man of birth and fortune ——"</Dia>

<Dia>"It is still more when his fortune is dissipated, his birth not more splendid than that of a hundred others, and yet the best thing he can call his own; a seat in parliament became a consummation devoutly to be desired, and no other vista presenting one but a distant perspective through the button-hole of a certain great earl and statesman."</Dia>

<Dia>"For which he must sacrifice every manly feeling, forfeit the right of thinking for himself, and serve a term of slavery long as the patriarch served for his beloved Rachel."</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh no, no, my dear fellow; in half that time, his virtues, his fortune, and his credit, will have faded away, and he, poor devil, be clapped in <QuotedLit>'durance vile,'</QuotedLit> to weep his folly and his desertion. His lordship must make shorter and surer work of it than the patriarch did."</Dia>

<Dia>"Well, at all events, he is not to be envied, poor wretch as he is! and nothing is more despicable than these mere men of fashion; faugh! they sicken me. But see, who have we here -— a new arrival, by Jove! and a showy one."</Dia>

<Dia>"The Dunbars, by Heavens! in all their continental elegance and refinement, with the Albanian Sydney to boot. Now, girls, be on your guard, or not a heart will Sydney leave, and he cannot take you all. As for us poor fellows, if we escape this blaze of beauty, there is no farther fear for us."</Dia>

<ArrivalDeparture>The new comers</ArrivalDeparture> consisted of a tall, gaunt, raw-boned man, at least six feet three in height, with tremendously red hair, beard, and whiskers, high cheek bones, deeply set small grey eyes, with a sinister expression, dun colour parchment cheeks, a wide mouth, thin purple lips, and large yellow teeth; a very stiff stock supported his long thin neck, and thrust into view two monstrous ears, of red and purple hue; from one immense chain was suspended his eyeglass, from another his watch, decorated with seals, bearing mottoes in every language, and the manufacture of all the continent: the other parts of his dress were equally overwrought and coxcomical.

On his arm hung a short, squat, Hottentot-looking figure, to whose ample and flaming face a full-dressed flaxen wig, with curls of surprising multiplicity, and an immense turban towering with feathers, and glittering with diamonds, gave added amplitude, brilliance, and depth of colouring: a yellow satin dress, radiant with spangles, covered with a rich lace drapery, left exposed to view a neck and shoulders fat enough to have secured the prize at an agricultural exhibition, and ornamented with diamonds, pearls, turquoises, and topazes, in rich profusion. Short thick arms, and fingers that scarcely looked human, displayed a like profusion of precious stones, Maltese chains, and fine pearls; while from each ear fell pendants, that gently reposed on each ample shoulder, except when entangled among their many rivals and compeers, that would fain rest there also.

Immediately following this extraordinary couple, was a tall, thin, willow-looking girl, pale even to sickness, with large light grey eyes, white eyebrows and eyelashes, and a great quantity of hair of the lightest flaxen, but clean, bright, and beautifully curling; a delicately turned nose, and a small infantine month, with regular white teeth, were the redeeming features of a face otherwise plain; a rich dress of pale blue satin and silver, and a cluster of blush roses in her hair, suited well with her complexion, and spoke of something like taste.

She leant on the arm of what might have been termed a handsome young man, had not an air of ridiculous affectation spoilt him, and all about him: Sydney had travelled through Greece, with a head full of lord Byron and his exploits; somebody had told him that he personally resembled that unfortunate nobleman -- his vanity told him he possessed the talents and genius likewise —- his sister and his mirror told him he had a finely-formed throat -— and every body told him how exquisitely becoming the Albanian dress was to his lordship. Behold Sydney then, with an open throat, falling collar, short curled head, and full Albanian costume; affecting a little lameness, talking mystically of disappointments and sorrows, and uttering poetical rhapsodies, the best of them borrowed from the late bard.

Such was the group that made their way through the superb suite of rooms, to the upper end where the countess was sitting. Her ladyship rose to receive them, and the striking contrast between the dignified countess, in her dress of black velvet, ornamented only with one magnificent bracelet, and a long string of large pearls round her neck, as she slightly bent her tall full figure to look down on the Indian squaw, who stood nodding her plumes, and chattering like one of her native macaws, was so apparent, and yet so ludicrous, that the younger part of the company found it irresistible, and the smile became general. <DiaM>"We are rather late, I fear, countess; but my young people are never to be hurried," <M>said sir Hector Dunbar, in a strong harsh voice, the vernacular accent of which a residence of thirty years in the East, and seven on the Continent of Europe, had not wholly destroyed</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"By no means, sir Hector; we have yet to receive the baron Blackurn, and his lady and her mother; but, my dear lady Dunbar, you have not yet introduced your son and daughter -— such, I presume —-"</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh yes, Ï beg your pardon, countess: —- Miss Dunbar —- Mr. Dunbar. Annastatia, I am sorry to say, is so extremely delicate, that I fear we must quickly remove her from this shocking cold damp climate: we shall see what London does for her, but I am very fearful. Sydney is in fine health; he looks delightful; but he will be quite spoilt -— I declare they make an idol of him wherever he goes; it was just so in Italy, France, and Spain —- indeed every where. -— Miss Alphington, your most obedient: ah, my dear, how I wish my Annastatia looked so healthy as you do! she would be better with less fortune and more health."</Dia>

All this time Sydney was playing off some of his finest graces before Madeline, nothing doubting that she was full of admiration of his figure, his head, his throat, and his costume; but to do so he was obliged to stand, for Mountstewart was seated by her side, and from thence nothing could remove him.

Lord Alphington now approached, to pay his devoirs to this eastern constellation. Lady Dunbar eyed him, as she would have done a tame monkey; with as little respect, and apparently as little admiration, she cried --<DiaQ>"Bless me, child, why do you wear a velvet stock? 'tis the very worst thing in the world for you sickly faces; plain people should always study effect."</DiaQ>

Now it never had entered the head of Alpington that he was plain; nor was he at all convinced now; but turning on his heel, voted lady Dunbar an <CharacterDiction>"uncivilized bore,"</CharacterDiction> and wondered how his mother ever came to tolerate such vulgarity.

The countess herself, was surprised, and gave the Indian lady a look expressive of her high aristocratic notions of good breeding. But in all probability the look was given in vain.<DiaM>"Can you tell me, Alphington, if your father contemplates turning Cotswold Park into a menagerie?" <M>asked Percival, as the door opened, and another party were announced</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"'Pon honour, no; but I suppose, as sir Hector has the best <i>blude in aw Scotland</i> running in his veins, and has spent some lacks of his rupees in the purchase of Hawkworth Hall, close to us, political reasons induce my father to admit his nondescript family, for the sake of himself."</Dia>

<ArrivalDeparture>The party who now slowly walked</ArrivalDeparture> up the rooms were also fresh arrivals from the Continent. The gentleman was again a tall raw-boned Scotchman; particularly stiff and forbidding in his aspect. His long withered head was covered with a black Brutus wig, that fitted closely round a pair of sharp projecting crimson ears, and descended, quite concealing the forehead, to shaggy grizzled eyebrows, that frowned sternly over small, deep-set, purblind-looking brown eyes; large features, with a sulky projecting mouth; and thin purple cheeks, falling in many wrinkles beneath his high prominent cheek-bones; a tight black stock, drawn over his chin, and close beneath his ears, gave one the idea of cutting off the upper part of his head. He was buttoned close up to his throat; yet, through a purposely-left aperture, gleamed a brilliant of the first water. His dark trowsers fell over his feet; and the buttonholes of his fashionably-cut coat were decorated with loops of red, green, purple, and white ribbon; while chain after chain ornamented the white waistcoat, and supported a splendid eyeglass, watch, and numerous seals; and as he drew off his glove, the long skinny red finger glittered with precious stones.

On one arm hung a fair, delicate-looking, elegant young creature, dressed with becoming taste, but apparently half asleep, and quite uninterested in all around her. On the other leant a handsome woman, of middle age, whose appearance betokened perfect satisfaction with herself, untinctured with the desire of looking younger, handsomer, or more fashionable than she really was. <DiaM>"Now, in the name of all that's good and sensible, who have we here?" <M>cried major Kenyon</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nay," <M>replied Horace Fitzwilliam, who stood near</M>, "invoke not the good nor the sensible, in behalf of your coxcomical monsieur le baron and madame le baroness, a <i>parvenue</i> of the first order. How found he an entrance into this high court of aristocratic nobility?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"That, Fitzwilliam, I cannot stop to inquire. But you, that know every thing, do tell me what mean those bits of coloured ribbon, dangling at his coat?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Mean, major! that a coxcomb of seventy is more despicable than a coxcomb of twenty -— more out of nature, but a coxcomb still! Look! look now! Mark his bow! Oh the puppy! he'll surely break, for bend he cannot! Oh, how I wish the old earles of Dumbarton, who saw him '<i>gang sooth</i>,' with naked feet and empty pockets, some threescore years since, could see him now! how they would claver and din!"</Dia>

<Dia>"Hold your tongue, you shocking libellous fellow! Don't believe a word he says, major; the fact is, he meant to marry madame himself, the moment she had thrown away her doll and pinafore, when lo! yon brawny Scot, with his hundred wrinkles, and his hundred thousand pounds, stept in before him -- a theft he cannot forgive."</Dia>

<Dia>"A fine woman, the baroness."</Dia>

<Dia>"Too inanimate, too milk and water."</Dia>

<Dia>"No, no, I cannot allow that -— spirit enough, and just proper <i>embonpoint pour une certaine age</i>."</Dia>

<Dia>"Now, major, by Juno herself, you are stumbling on the widowed mother."</Dia>

<Dia>"Tush, Fitz! you do not pretend to say that pretty sleepy girl is wife to yon don Wrinkleando?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Yes, on my soul! and, to do the old fool justice, he looked twenty years younger before he married than now."</Dia>

<Dia>"Does he fret then? or is he antiquated?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Ancient, positively ancient! But, <i>voila son rôle</i>! Having picked up some knowledge of the law in Scotland, he was seized with the desire of extending his information; so packed up his 'bit claese,' and a 'wee pickle o' meal,' and with a few baubees in his pocket, set forward sooth. Chance, or his good genius, soon introduced him to a crack-brained old miser, to whom he booed and booed so effectually, as to persuade the old man (by what sort of arguments the lawyer knows best) to leave him his large fortune. Some distant cousins, however, contended the matter for years; so that the best thirty years of his life was spent in cringing and contention, getting a brief now and then, and heroically gulping down the sneers and gibes of his brother gownsmen. During this long period of slavery, and for several years afterwards, he appeared to have forgotten that such things as love or matrimony existed; when, suddenly seized with the desire of having an heir to his large property, he pensioned off his old north country mistress, and, heigh, presto! was a married man and monsieur le baron in no time."</Dia>

<Dia>"Very good; but how comes the title to be French?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh, bless them! all the Continent has witnessed their conjugal felicity; and in Paris the title and bits of coloured ribbon were obtained. We all like to bring home some curiosity or other, you know."</Dia>

<Dia>"So, like the daw in borrowed plumes, the old beau now sports a title, <i>par courtoisie</i>, and ribbons of doubtful meaning."</Dia>

<Dia>"And where is the desired heir?"</Dia>

<Dia>"In Utopia, where it will ever remain."</Dia>

<Dia>"I need not ask, are they happy? they cannot be."</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh, <i>pour cela</i>, they are much like others; she is very quiet, and he watches her as the dragon the Hesperian fruits; but dresses, and keeps her well; and the mother, perfectly satisfied, manages every thing."</Dia>

The butler here put an end to scandal.</SceneDia>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. III</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia><DiaM>"How I detest an English dinner party!" <M>cried Sydney Dunbar, throwing himself languidly on a sofa, the morning after their first visit to Cotswold</M>; "it is all eating, drinking, and politics: now, eating moderately is sensible enough, but drinking, beyond a few glasses of light wine, is disgusting; and politics -- oh, ye gods, spare my head such another horrid din of cross, snarling politics! a bedlam were as good, and madmen better company."</DiaM>

<Dia>"All Englishmen are politicians, you know, Sydney; and, as we have now settled down in England, and become considerable landed proprietors, it is as well to pay some attention to the politics of the country."</Dia>

<Dia>"Be all the labour, and all the honour, your own, sir Hector; I will never dispute it with you."</Dia>

<Dia>"Yet, Sydney, your favourite bard entered warmly into the politics of another country."</Dia>

<Dia>"Ay, dear sir, that was quite a different sort of thing; I am myself a warm friend to the Greeks -— what generous or enthusiastic mind can have lived among them, and not be so? a patriot is a noble character. What I complain of is, your self-willed, thick-headed, quarrelsome, wine-drinking, English politician!"</Dia>

"Our English friends are greatly obliged to you, Sydney; you'll be sure to make your way among them, if you make known opinions so flattering," returned the baronet, ironically, who never, for a moment, forgot <i>making his way</i>.

<Dia>"Never fear; sir, but I shall gain admirers, even though I do not gormandize, get drunk, swear like a drayman, or snarl over politics like a brute."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Sydney," <M>asked the fair Annastatia</M>, "is it true that lord Byron used to get intoxicated every day?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Profanation, my dear; where did you pick up such an idea?"</Dia>

<Dia>"I heard it yesterday at Cotswold, where your remarkable likeness to him drew general observation; every body inquired, were you relations? and could scarcely credit that you were not."</Dia>

<Dia>"I should not be very proud of the resemblance though, if I could fancy him addicted to the vice you name."</Dia>

<DiaM>"There is but little doubt of the fact, I fancy," <M>said sir Hector</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"They were all saying so at that place last night," <M>said lady Dunbar</M>; "and some of them, I think, said they had seen it -— did they not, darling?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Oh, yes; major Kenyon and captain Thornhill both said so, and they appeared to have been intimately acquainted with him."</Dia>

<Dia>"Acquainted with him, Annastatia! with the brightest genius this foggy island ever produced! oh, happy, enviable men, is it possible?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Indeed, Sydney, it appears to have been very possible; and though they allowed him to possess genius and eminent talent, they did not give him that unqualified admiration you do."</Dia>

<Dia>"Envy, my dear, all envy; by finding blots in his bright character, they brought him nearer the level of themselves; I will never believe that such an immortal genius could descend to the beastly vice of intoxication."</Dia>

<Dia>"Well, I thought you must know best; but I assure you they all said so."</Dia>

<Dia>"All envy, depend upon it; the English, as a nation, are fond of defamation."</Dia>

<Dia>"I wish the earl of Caerphillon heard you say that, Sydney; you never saw nor heard a finer man than that in any country; one would think him Scotch, an 'twere not for his very large eyes."</Dia>

<Dia>"Why, indeed, sir, it would be paying any country a compliment to say the Caerphillon family belonged to it, for they seem to have made every grace and beauty their own."</Dia>

<Dia>"You do not call that young whitefaced lord handsome, Sydney, my dear? the poorest little wretch I ever saw; one would think he had been bred up in an oven."</Dia>

<Dia>"That is illiberal of you, my dear mother, to select poor Alphington as an exception; what think you of lady Madeline?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Oh, she is very well; rather too much colour —- somewhat too lively," <M>glancing at her own pale daughter</M>; "what think <i>you</i> of her, Sydney?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Think, Annastatia, that she is the most beautiful creature under heaven, an houri from the paradise of Mahomet; such dark eyes, such delicate eyebrows, such Grecian contour -— one would think she had been born in the east."</Dia>

<Dia>"Nay, Sydney, the Circassians are fair, with blue eyes."</Dia>

<Dia>"Ay, so they are; but there is something about Madeline, of a warm, rich, voluptuous Eastern beauty, far excelling a Circassian; oh, she is magnificent! But now, my dear, what think <i>you</i> of her cousin?"</Dia>

<Dia>"What, Miss Gresham?"</Dia>

<Dia>"No, Miss Innocence, not Miss Gresham, but Percival Alphington."</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh, him! he is certainly very handsome, very elegant, and very entertaining, but fearfully satirical. Oh, if you had but heard how severe he was on the baron Blackurn and Mrs. Selwood!"</Dia>

<Dia>"And no wonder; I always feel inclined to turn on my heel when the old puppy speaks to me."</Dia>

<Dia>"Mrs. Selwood was certainly to blame to marry her daughter to him, merely for money; but she seems happy enough."</Dia>

<Dia>"Ay, to be sure; she has a fine carriage, fine diamonds, a husband, and plenty of money —- what else should she want?"</Dia>

<Dia>"A husband she could love and respect, I should think, papa, instead of that cross-looking, old, brown, frizzled man."</Dia>

<Dia>"Upon my word, sir Hector, I think your countrymen are very inconsistent people; they dress and fit out their daughters at a great expence, and send them to the East, like dolls, to be sold to the best bidder; and once they are married to some sickly, yellow, old bashaw, the parents congratulate themselves, and are complimented on, the great success of their daughters. Now, here is the very same thing happened, without the trouble of going ten thousand miles after it, and all the mothers, fathers, and daughters, are shocked at it; and why for, I ask?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Because, my dear, '<i>going out</i>' is all right and proper, <i>selon les regles</i>; but a young girl marrying her grandfather, in the very face of younger men and elder women, who would happily have supplied the respective places, is quite <i>contre les regles</i> -- an absolute outrage; but, as Sydney says, it's envy, all envy, nothing else, depend upon it."</Dia>

<Dia>"Indeed I believe it. I wonder what girls are to do in a country like England, without money, even though they are pretty; on the Continent, and in my quarter of the world, things are managed better; but here, gold alone commands. I think Mrs. Selwood acted like a sensible woman in securing such a match."</Dia>

<Dia>"She would have done much better, mamma, in marrying him herself."</Dia>

<Dia>"Suppose he would not have her."</Dia>

<Dia>"Then she did not know how to play her cards."</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh ho, Miss Dunbar, these are your sentiments, are they!"</Dia>

<Dia>"Why you know, mamma, if money was the only consideration --"</Dia>

<Dia>"You think the mother should have sacrificed herself, rather than her daughter, and you are right; but never fear; madame will revenge herself; you will hear some day that she is off with some one or other of us, her dying swains."</Dia>

<Dia>"Why yes, my laddy, ye would find it a dying affair, I fancy; the old Scot would not hesitate to send a bullet through yere head, without speering many questions."</Dia>

<Dia>"They are all safe, papa, for the old beau never lets her out of his sight, nor takes his eyes off her, as Miss Gresham says he has learnt, to perfection, to keep his eyes at the same time on his ribbons and his wife, the two grand acquirements of his latter life, to gain which he bartered the hard earnings of threescore years."</Dia>

<Dia>"They may well be his idols then; but I wonder what the superb countess really thought of them; she was particularly kind to madame -— did you not say so, Annastatia?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"The countess!" <M>exclaimed sir Hector</M>; "ay, there's the woman to admire, to worship, to copy; in her, lady Dunbar in her, Annastatia, you see a specimen of true English nobility! I have never seen any thing like her, since I last saw lady Katherine Dunbar, my mother; they are alike as two pearls."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Indeed, sir Hector, I cannot think it at all necessary for you to look beyond your own family for beauty or grandeur; the countess is a large, tall, proud-looking woman; but I don't think lady Dunbar needs <i>copy</i> any one, or fear being excelled; and as for children, you, sir Hector, need not envy any one -— none can surpass your own."</Dia>

<Dia>"I beg your pardon, my dear; pray do not feel offended by my remarks; I never, for a moment, thought of drawing a comparison between you and the countess; you are both dignified women, of high rank and fortune, and will, I hope, be great friends; I am as sensible as any man living of my advantages, and have as high an opinion of my family."</Dia>

<Dia>"Heigh ho! Statia, my love, ring the bell -— you are sitting near it; positively La Fitte must bathe me immediately with eau de Cologne after this matrimonial fracas: what say you, Statia -— does it increase your desire to wear the mystic bondage?"</Dia>

<Dia>"How can that be mourned which never existed, Sydney?"</Dia>

<Dia>"What mean you, child?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Only that never having felt any desire to wear this mystic bondage, I cannot be sensible of an increase or decrease."</Dia>

<Dia>"Positively, Statia, that is too rational, too logical; a female that reasons is an abomination; to be charming, they must be soft, melting, yielding, loving, timid, caressing creatures."</Dia>

<Dia>"In one word, Sydney, pretty fools."</Dia>

<Dia>"Certainly, better be fools than <i>wise</i>: a woman should look up to us for everything -- hang on us for life itself."</Dia>

<Dia>"Then you do not admire Catharine Gresham; she looks very much as though she could think for herself."</Dia>

<Dia>"Does she? -- perhaps she does; but then she is so very beautiful, that one must forgive her: I would not, however, chuse Catharine for a wife."</Dia>

<Dia>"You would prefer Madeline."</Dia>

<Dia>"Yes, I think I should."</Dia>

<Dia>"Yonder comes the baron and his '<i>calmy cold</i>,' fair wife: they are riding their Arabians slowly up the lawn: poor thing, her countenance always says --
<QuotedLit>'I am a slave -- a favour'd slave at best, 
To share his splendour, and seem very blest.'</QuotedLit></Dia>

<Dia>"You think then she does not love the baron?"</Dia>

<Dia>"<QuotedLit>'My love ---'</QuotedLit>
Oh no, no, not my love!
<QuotedLit>'Yet once this heart, that strives no more, once strove
To meet his passion -- but it would not be.</QuotedLit>'"</Dia>

<DiaM>"I doubt the letter part of your quotation very much," <M>said lady Dunbar</M>; "but I'll ask her."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Mamma, think what you say."</Dia>

<Dia>"How will you manage that, good mother?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Take care, lady Dunbar, or ye'll never make your way here."</Dia>

These characteristic ejaculations were put an end to by <ArrivalDeparture>the entrance of</ArrivalDeparture> the baron Blackurn and his lady, between whom and the Dunbars a thousand expressions of kindness were quickly exchanged -- <DiaM>"But, Sydney," <M>cried the baron</M>, "why are you stretching on a sofa this fine morning? Have you not been out?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Out! name it not, my dear sir, I beseech you. I am half dead from fatigue since yesterday; I never will patronise great dinners and politics -- they are equally disgusting."</Dia>

<Dia>"Heard ye ever the like of that! and you a young man! why, Sydney, you must attend great dinners, give great dinners, promise good eating, and get into parliament: what else did you come to England for?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Come to England, my dear sir! -— to enjoy the society of creation's fairest part! To sir Hector I must willingly yield dinners and politics."</Dia>

<Dia>"But do ye know your great favourite, that you so much resemble, loved good dinners and politics?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Did he -- <i>n'importe</i>, I know he loved the fair daughters of Eve, and that part of his character will suffice for me."</Dia>

<DiaM>"That we can never allow," <M>cried the baroness</M>; "he was a vile husband; and you, Sydney, are --"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Am what! -— so amiable, that I must make a good one —- is that what you would say?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Well, I believe that is what I would say."</Dia>

<Dia>"Yes, my dear baroness, and so would his lordship; but fancy a heart so warm, united to an icicle -— to one incapable of feeling -— think you that one who wrote so well, could act so ill? -— that one who so well knew the female heart, could slight and despise the precious gift?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Indeed, I am afraid of it, Sydney; but let me bathe your head; you look as though it really did ache."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Ah!" <M>ejaculated Sydney</M> —-
<QuotedLit>'Oh, woman, in our hours of ease, 
Uncertain, coy, and hard to please ---
When pain and sickness cloud the brain, 
A ministering angel thou.'</QuotedLit>"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Very fair; but why omit the interesting lines, my good sir?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Now, madame, I never will submit to be called <i>good sir</i>, at least not these fifty years: a grey-bearded bachelor, or a great-grandfather, are the only persons who should be thus addressed."</Dia>

<DiaM>"You are acquainted," <M>said lady Dunbar</M>, "with Byron's <i>unapproachable</i> poem (I learnt that phrase at Cotswold yesterday. You see I can learn, although a native of the east)."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Well, then, my dear baroness, you have read Byron's Corsair?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh, certainly: who is there so stupid, so dull, as to be ignorant of that exquisite work, though not possessing the happiness of an acquaintance with the charming family of sir Hector Dunbar."</Dia>

<Dia>"Well then, my dear, I must have your opinion on the point we were discussing when you appeared in sight, and chased every subject but yourself. Statia thinks there are many 'Gulnares' -- Sydney that there never was one; now, what think you?"</Dia>

<Dia>"You will not give an opinion on that, I think, my dear."</Dia>

<Dia>"Indeed, baron, I shall; for the fact is, I think there was just one, and no more."</Dia>

<Dia>"Then you do not give one part credit for imagination, madame?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Not much, I must confess, but great credit for telling the same story in many different ways, and working on the imagination of others, who possess more feeling and less display than he did."</Dia>

<Dia>"This is positive treason, and I cannot patronize it, even in you."</Dia>

<Dia>"I am sorry to hear you say so, Sydney: you and I are great friends; but I claim a right of opinion."</Dia>

<Dia>"Nay, don't do that; for I hate women who have <i>an opinion</i>: you are too lovely to form opinions, and defend them; nothing but old and ugly women should pretend to such a hideous thing."</Dia>

<Dia>"And so you think, my dear, that Gulnare did love Sneyd?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Not I indeed! I dare say she loved, or fancied she loved (much the same thing, by the bye), that mysterious, fascinating pirate leader, Conrad."</Dia>

<Dia>"But do you not think any young creature, married to a stern old husband she hates, would do the same?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Hates! it does not appear she ever did hate him; I think she loves him thus, or very like it -- 
<QuotedLit>'From one I never loved enough to hate.'</QuotedLit>
And again -— 
<QuotedLit>'Have I ever proved that passion's seal, 
The change to hatred were at least to feel.'</QuotedLit>"</Dia>

<Dia>"No, no; women are not such fools as this lady poet would make them appear!"</Dia>

<Dia>"Then you think a woman thus married may hide her misery?"</Dia>

<Dia>"I should think so."</Dia>

<Dia>"But fancy some all-powerful Conrad!"</Dia>

<Dia>"I shall fancy no such nonsense; it does very well in a poem; but depend on it, 'tis not nature."</Dia>

The gentlemen were now engaged in an <QuotesOther>"apart'"</QuotesOther> discussion on meadow land, grazing land, &c.; and the youthful baroness stood leaning against the window, where lady Dunbar sat, and seeing much farther into her designs than the Indian supposed, and such soft blue eyes could do: taking courage, her ladyship replied -— <DiaQ>"Is it in nature, my dear, to be constant to a man you do <i>not</i> love, when one you <i>can</i> love is constantly before your eyes? or is it in nature to hide the disgust and misery that must be the consequence of such a sacrifice?"</DiaQ>

<Dia>"Really, my dear lady Dunbar, these questions are rather out of my usual line of study; I should, however, hope, that any female, for her own sake, as well as that of her husband, would act with becoming dignity and propriety; but you, having seen so many modern marriages, must know best how to answer your own questions."</Dia>

<Dia>"Perhaps I do; but I believe the wisest way is to keep the answer to myself."</Dia>

<Dia>"I think so too."</Dia>

<Dia>"It is not a grateful subject to a happy wife -- is it, baroness?"</Dia>

<Dia>"In truth, Miss Dunbar, it is not; nor one on which she can well decide; I am, however, of opinion, that every woman should quietly take her lot, and not feed a sickly or wandering taste and imagination, to the certain ruin of her peace, and that of her family."</Dia>

<Dia>"I believe you are quite right; but it would appear our poet thought otherwise."</Dia>

<Dia>"Our poet, my dear girl, did not write to improve mankind, much less womankind; he wrote to astonish, to fascinate, and to improve his own purse -— what plain common sense would not have done."</Dia>

<Dia>"Do you know, I think it might, if but for the novelty; nothing like it has appeared for many years."</Dia>

<DiaM>"How did you enjoy your visit yesterday, my dear?" <M>abruptly asked her ladyship</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Oh, more than I can express -- I was charmed! the party, the family, and the entertainment, were all in a superb style; I should delight to live near them."</Dia>

<Dia>"Is not Percival exquisitely handsome?"</Dia>

<Dia>"I scarcely saw him -— lady Madeline is very beautiful, and the countess a most superior woman; mamma thinks her unequalled."</Dia>

<Dia>"Have they no other children?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Oh, lots," <M>cried Sydney, turning from his agricultural discussion</M>; "there is a daughter, sixteen years old, that they keep in a nursery, and another precious honourable son with her, I believe; and a cousin, or some such thing, a young Spanish girl, whom they never admit when there is company, but for whose acquaintance I have a longing desire."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I think yere wrong, sir," <M>said the baron</M>; "I weel remember the earl a young man, and he had then no brother; I was myself vary young at the time, to be sure —- just a laddy, at the high scule o'Edinburgh, but I weel remember it."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The earl looks many years younger than you, baron; but it is to be considered he has had an easier life; care makes a young man grey," <M>said lady Dunbar, coolly</M>.</DiaM>

The baron's purple ears were black with anger; he, however, had his own reasons for temporizing; so, swallowing his angry feelings, he coolly replied -— <DiaQ>"The earl will be too much the statesman, my lady, to have led a vary easy life; but ye will ken him better awhile."</DiaQ>

<Dia>"Common civility, I believe, should take us gentlemen to Cotswold, this morning, to make inquiries."</Dia>

<Dia>"Thank you, papa, for the hint; but why not the ladies? I propose that we all go. What say you, madame? -- what say you, mamma? Nay, do not look a negative -— you must go, indeed you must."</Dia>

<DiaM>"The weather is warm, and I am weary —- let them come to us," <M>replied the lady</M>, with some jealous feeling.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That cannot be; but if you will not go, Statia can accept the escort of her father and brother, and call with madame; so prepare, my dear girl; and, I say remember, it is morning in the country -— do not be too fine," <M>said Sydney, as his sister ran to put on her bonnet, and his mother resolved to do the same</M>.</DiaM></SceneDia>

<ChapMarker>CHAP. IV.</ChapMarker>

<SceneDia><DiaQ>"Well, Madeline, my dear, have you got the sketch from the dell for me? they tell me you have a rapid pencil; and I care not how lightly it is done, if the view be just."</DiaQ>

<Dia>"I have it, papa, quite ready for you —- I will run and fetch it -- you will be pleased, I hope, though it is only a sketch, you know."</Dia>

Percival secretly wondered when she had found time to copy Georgette's drawing, and begun to think she really had a rapid pencil, as the countess remarked she was glad of an opportunity of judging of her daughter's proficiency. -- <DiaM>"I have occasionally," <M>continued she</M>, "looked into her sketch-book, but saw only some indifferent attempts, too <i>young lady</i> like to please me, and too indistinct to inform me."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I certainly should never say Madeline's most shining talent was drawing," <M>said Catharine Gresham</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I never," <M>squeaked the little lord</M>, "saw a decent thing of her performance."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh fie, my lord!" <M>cried Miss Grey, who had been toadying of it the whole summer at Cotswold, and thought herself obliged to ring changes on the <CharacterDiction>"lovely, accomplished lady Madeline;"</CharacterDiction></M> "oh fie, fie! every thing lady Madeline does, is done well! -— and what is there she does not do -— so good, so clever, so amiable, so industrious! I am often lost in astonishment at her talents."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Where did Miss Grey say she had been lost?"</Dia>

<Dia>"In astonishment, sir John."</Dia>

<Dia>"Pray will you have the goodness to inform us in what part of the globe that is?"</Dia>

<Dia>"The globe, sir John!"</Dia>

<Dia>"Ay, the globe, Miss Grey."</Dia>

<Dia>"It is not on the globe -— I don't understand you."</Dia>

<Dia>"Don't you; well, now, that is particularly unfortunate, because, if you should be lost again, I should not know where to find you."</Dia>

<DiaM>"A loss easily replaced," <M>muttered his neighbour</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I beg your pardon," <M>returned sir John</M>; "I should consider it an irreparable loss -- Miss Grey is unrivalled."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ha, ha, ha!" <M>shouted Alphington</M>; "a good one that! Miss Grey, you are done! -— completely finished!"</DiaM>

<Dia>"How comes it, Alphington, that we have the honour of your company this morning? I thought you would have committed desperate havock among the partridges before this hour."</Dia>

<Dia>"I don't know, sir John, how it happened, but I was not in the humour this morning."</Dia>

<DiaM>"So I should expect," <M>replied the baronet, drily</M>.</DiaM> 

<DiaM>"There, dear papa, is the sketch," <M>cried Madeline, returning</M>; "did you not begin to think I had forgotten what I went for?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Thank you, my dear; but I fear your breakfast will be cold," <M>replied the earl, as, laying aside the newspaper, he took the drawing from the fair hand of his daughter</M>; "but what detained you so long, Madeline?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Have I been gone long? -— the foliage wanted some little touching up."</Dia>

<DiaM>"This, Madeline," <M>said the earl, who was an excellent judge</M>, "is a spirited good thing -- quite a finished drawing; I congratulate you and myself on your talents this way. But when, my dear, did you find time to execute it?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Now, my lord, acknowledge that sweet lady Madeline is industrious and clever, though every body will not allow it," <M>cried Miss Grey, casting a spiteful look at Catharine</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"An exquisite touch! -- a master's hand! -- such spirit -— such taste! —- so true to nature! -- the light and shade so just -- so beautiful!" <M>exclaimed the earl, as, turning the drawing, he viewed it in every different light</M>.</DiaM>

Several of the younger part of the company gathered around him; Alphington, looking over his shoulder, cried -- <DiaQ>"That drawing done by by Madeline! Why, my dear, you were inspired! But do tell me how long you have been about it."</DiaQ>

<Dia>"It was only sketched yesterday morning, and is by no means a finished drawing."</Dia>

<DiaM>"You will be delighted, my dear, to see that your daughter excels as much in this fascinating science, as she does in the more showy one of music," <M>said the earl, handing the drawing to his wife, and kissing the open forehead of his daughter</M>.</DiaM>

The countess passed a high eulogium on the performance, and passed it round the table.

Percival cast a cursory glance on it, at the same time handing Madeline a cup of chocolate, said, in a low tone of half serious mockery -— <DiaQ>"Be careful how you swallow it; it would be misery to see you choked."</DiaQ>

<Dia>"Do you not admire the drawing, Percival, that you pass it on so fast?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh, yes, my dear aunt; but I know the spot well, and have seen the drawing before."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Percival, what are you talking about?" <M>exclaimed Madeline, in affright</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"What, is it to be a secret then, that I saw this work in its process? I will fetch your sketch-book, and prove it."</Dia>

<Dia>"Indeed; sir, you will do no such thing."</Dia>

<Dia>"Don't alarm yourself, my dear, I will not; so drink your chocolate, if you <i>can</i>, without fear."</Dia>

Lady Caerphillon looked uneasy -— <DiaM>"It cannot be," <M>said she, and in soliloquy</M>.</DiaM>

Catharine looked at Percival; their eyes met -— <Dia>"You are wrong; I did not touch it."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I am glad to hear it," <M>said the countess</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Edith draws well, I think, aunt."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Very well, Catharine, with great spirit, but not in this style," <M>again examining the paper</M>; "indeed there is an originality here -— a depth of expression I have seldom seen equalled. Observe this child on the grass; what a striking likeness of my little Egbert! though in pencil only, the child's eyes are speaking, as Alphington says; Madeline must have been inspired when she did this."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Here is an originality I thihk none of you have observed, and which accounts for the peculiarity of the foliage," <M>replied Catharine</M>; "do, pray, observe this branch."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"An excellent profile of the earl!" <M>cried one and all</M>. "Oh, and your ladyship to the life!"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Alphington, here you are, in all your beauty, perched on the top of an oak tree."</Dia>

<Dia>"Excellent! and here, see here is dear Edith, bending over this water, in a willow branch."</Dia>

<DiaM>"And Percival," <M>cried Catharine</M>, "here he is: -- here you are, sir; not on the top, but supporting this noble oak: I say, Percival, there is more here than meets the eye at once."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Yes, sweet Catharine, there is; but in common civility I am bound to discover Miss Gresham in the elegant foliage of this acacia; a more correct profile was never seen."</Dia>

<DiaM>"But," <M>cried the earl, laughing</M>, "do tell me, Madeline, how you came to place Mountstewart in a thorn bush? A most ignoble place for his lordship, is it not?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"I did not think so, papa."</Dia>

<DiaM>"But why crown him with nightshade, my pretty Madge?" <M>asked Percival, pointedly</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh," <M>laughed Mountstewart</M>, "I have no cause of complaint; lady Madeline has placed herself close by me."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, famous, famous!" <M>shrieked Alphington</M>; "Madeline to the life! Ah, and here is little Grey groping in the mud, as I live, and Edith bending over them all."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes, indeed," <M>cried Mountstewart</M>; "and in the distant trees, see Thornhill's immense proboscis, and goody Ramsey's keen nose and chin. My dear lady Madeline, I shall adore you more than ever: why, the very sheep and dogs are likenesses; there's Staffa, with his five houris, at the head of his harem; and here is Percival's Newfoundland to the life."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Madeline, my darling, where have you so long hid this charming talent -- and why let accident develope it at last?" <M>asked the delighted father</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Why, papa, do you know it is half fancy now; the likenesses, many of them, may be traced to accident, and not design."</Dia>

<Dia>"More than half, Madeline; for instance, <i>you</i> never intended to place me in an honourable station, and Mountstewart in a dishonourable one, did you?"</Dia>

<Dia>"I certainly never designed to place lord Mountstewart in a dishonourable station, Percival; but I assure you they are imaginary profiles, almost all."</Dia>

<Dia>"Which of them did you designedly draw, Madeline?"</Dia>

<Dia>"I shall not confess to you, my saucy cousin."</Dia>

<Dia>"Wont you? I think you will."</Dia>

<Dia>"Then you are mistaken, depend upon it."</Dia>

<Dia>"Never less, fair Madeline; do you not know that I alone, of all this goodly company, was privy to this drawing, and marked its progress, that I only can appreciate the <i>depth</i> of your talent, and the <i>profundity</i> of your judgment."</Dia>

<Dia>"Such conceit! Yet even <i>you</i> were not aware of the profiles."</Dia>

<Dia>"But I shall be aware of them; for you will tell me all when we get another snug quiet morning."</Dia>

<DiaM>"That I never shall," <M>said Madeline, shrinking from her cousin's eye</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Now, Madeline," <M>said her mother</M>, "as you have so charmed your father, let me lay claim to a specimen of your abilities; I have long wished for a drawing of the fairy's grot, and the little waterfall adjoining, and had thought to request it of Catharine; but I shall be much better pleased with a drawing of yours; you will perhaps do it in a few days, my love."</DiaM>

<Dia>"With the greatest pleasure, mamma; but you will not require profiles."</Dia>

<Dia>"I do not make any terms; I shall, as your father did, trust to your generosity."</Dia>

<Dia>"And you will not be disappointed, my dear lady."</Dia>

<Dia>"I think so too, Miss Grey, for certainly Madeline has greatly improved lately."</Dia>

<Dia>"Wonderfully; but, my dear aunt, you must allow me the pleasure of doing some favourite spot for you; though I am but poor at likeness, I can touch landscape tolerably."</Dia>

Percival now held up a card that had fallen from Catharine's reticule, and exclaimed, laughing -- <DiaQ>"Behold a specimen of this lady, who is '<i>poor at likeness</i>;' here is a proof that convicts her on the spot, of a most accurate eye and excellent taste."</DiaQ>

<Dia>"This is not fair, Percival; one's private fancies should not be made public; perhaps I did wrong in indulging such a mere fancy."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Catharine is right," <M>said the countess, taking the card</M>; "this is a pretty allegorical sketch; but her likenesses are so faithful, that prudence and politeness both forbid an exposure of her exquisite talent."</DiaM>

<Dia>"I quite long to see that pretty baroness again; 'pon my honour, I feel half inclined to run away with her; it would only be serving the old man as he deserves."</Dia>

<Dia>"Alphington, for shame!"</Dia>

<Dia>"That's famous, Alphington -— you promise well."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I am sorry to differ in opinion, sir John, and ashamed that a son of mine should have expressed himself thus idly," <M>said the earl, haughtily, as bowing, he left the room, followed by several other gentlemen, to whom national and country business was more interesting than the ladies</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It is useless for my father to feel offended at a mere joke," <M>said Alphington, with pique</M>; "all the world are at liberty to amuse themselves."</DiaM>

<Dia>"You chose an unfortunate subject for your joke; the earl is particularly nice where females are concerned."</Dia>

<Dia>"I know all that; but your ladyship may depend on it, that some fine fellow or other, though not myself perhaps, will run away with the baroness."</Dia>

<DiaM>"At all events, vanity is not confined to our sex," <M>returned the countess, measuring her son with an eye of slight contempt</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Whoever forms such an opinion of the baroness," <M>cried Catharine, warmly</M>, "is strangely mistaken; she is chaste and pure as newly-fallen snow."</DiaM>

<Dia>"And as cold too."</Dia>

<Dia>"Happy for her if she be."</Dia>

<Dia>"And happy for her ugly jailer too."</Dia>

<Dia>"Tush! the sour grapes are not worth grasping for; the fair Indianna, who is comeatable with honour, is by far the prettiest woman. Pray, aunt, is she accomplished?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Rich, her ingot-looking mamma took care to tell us she was."</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh, that mamma! an itinerant jeweller's <i>boutique</i>."</Dia>

<Dia>"Positively she reminded one of an elephant laden with jewels."</Dia>

<Dia>"The vulgar wretches, what could put it into their heads to sit down in this neighbourhood?"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Vulgar! you surely forget the exquisite Sydney; but, mamma," <M>continued Alphington, eagerly</M>, "what will you do with your menagerie in the winter? you surely cannot exhibit them in town?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof, my dear."</Dia>

<Dia>"True, mamma; but you must excuse my astonishment at seeing CotsWold Park a receptacle for such nondescript animals, without even rank to smooth over their demi-savage natures, and your ladyship turning show-woman."</Dia>

The raised colour of the countess showed even Alphington he must not venture farther.

<DiaM>"What has become," <M>asked Mountstewart, laying down his book</M>, "of our own sweet, lovely, elegant lady Madeline? I long for a little music."</DiaM>

<Dia>"And can nobody please you but Madeline? I lay a wager she is gone to put her drawing in a state of forwardness."</Dia>

<Dia>"What do you mean, Percival? Madeline would not walk two miles alone. I strongly suspect you have a secret hand in these miraculous drawings."</Dia>

<Dia>"No, upon my honour I never touched the thing -— but here comes Madeline. Madge, my beautiful cousin, I cannot make them give you full credit for all you deserve; and poor Mountstewart is dying for music, which you alone, of all the fair daughters of harmony, can charm him with."</Dia>

Mountstewart had already taken her hand, and leading her towards the instrument, implored she would harmonise his distracted senses by the distinct tones of her angelic voice. <Dia>"Oh, with pleasure, for notwithstanding all that illnatured Percival says, I don't think <i>you</i> will satirize."</Dia>

<Dia>"Never, oh never, divine lady Madeline."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Never, oh never, divine Miss Grey, did I see such a charming picture of patient industry as yourself," <M>exclaimed Percival, mimicking Mountstewart most faithfully</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"I certainly am industrious, Mr. Alphington, especially when I am obliging my friends."</Dia>

<Dia>"Amiable excellence! how much precious eyesight, and precious daylight, paint, paper, and gum, and how much useless time, have you ingeniously contrived to exhaust on that amusing, perplexing, stupifying, puzzling, flimsy firescreen; what think you of calling it the Grey <i>chef d'œuvre</i>."</Dia>

<Dia>"Upon my word, Mr, Alphington, you --"</Dia>

<Dia>"Upon my honour, Miss Grey, you --"</Dia>

<Dia>"Really, Mr. Alphington —-"</Dia>

<Dia>"Really, Miss Grey —-"</Dia>

<Dia>"I'm sure sir, I --"</Dia>

<Dia>"I'm sure, ma'am —-"</Dia>

<DiaM>"Oh, ye gods and fishes!" <M>shouted sir John</M>, "here they are; Alphington, here is your menagerie, all alive, and looking -- ye gods, how they do look!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Away!" <M>cried Alphington</M>, "away with your work, Catharine! away with hodge-podge screens! away with books, music, drawings, and all, or these baboons, monkeys, mackaws, and shahs, all newly arrived from Bombay, will fall upon, tear, and destroy without mercy!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No, no, no," <M>laughed sir John</M>; "let us hear their charming remarks; and, ladies, listen with attention, for they will give you news from afar."</DiaM>

<ArrivalDeparture>The door was thrown open</ArrivalDeparture>, with even more than usual pomp and ceremony. <CharacterDiction>"The baron and baroness Blackurn," "Mrs, Selwood," "Sir Hector and lady Dunbar," "Mr, and Miss Dunbar,"</CharacterDiction> were announced, with all the form considered indispensable at Cotswold; and now commenced such a string of inquiries, congratulations, shakings of hands, compliments, and eulogium, as might have deceived one who knew nothing of the world, and led them to conclude this a meeting of dear and attached friends.

<DiaM>"I am indeed most gratified by this friendly call," <M>said the countess, in her own elegant and impressive manner</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I never paid a visit with greater pleasure," <M>replied her fat ladyship</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have thought of nothing but you, divine Annastatia, since I saw you -— dreamt of you -— talked of you -— raved of you," <M>squeaked the puny lord</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You may believe him, fair lady," <M>said Percival</M>; "he grew so eloquent this morning, we began to look around for a proper attendant on moon-struck lovers."</DiaM>

<Dia>"Oh, these rooms! the classic decorations! the superb party! they have all swam before my eyes like fairy land to-night; but your voice, sweetest of warblers, that hangs like charmed sounds of unreal harmony around mine entranced ear, wrapping my soul in Elysium, by the magic of its music!"</Dia>

<Dia>"You are polite, Mr. Dunbar; but my voice cannot equal those Grecian syrens you so eloquently described last night; I assure you, I have thought of nothing else since, and am almost out of conceit with my own poor performance."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Well, my fair baroness," <M>cried sir John</M>, "may I venture to inquire how you contrived to rise so early, and break on us like the chaste star of morning, so mild, and yet so brilliant?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"I always rise early; and in the country a morning ride is delightful. I enjoy being on horseback."</Dia>

<Dia>"Come here, sir Hector; come here this minute, and see this curious beautiful family group, all in trees and shrubs, done by lady Madeline Alphington. I declare Statia shall take lessons from the same master immediately. Who was he, my dear? I don't mind expence."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I have no master in the country, madam; when in town, I take lessons from all the first professors," <M>replied Madeline, with a curl of her beautiful lip</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The artist herself may perhaps be prevailed on to give Miss Dunbar a few lessons. Shall I undertake to persuade her?" <M>asked Percival, with a smile of arch meaning</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Yes, do, there's a dear good young gentleman."</Dia>

<Dia>"Hush, mamma; I could never think of such a thing."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Pray," <M>said the baroness</M>, "whose face is this? It is an eminently beautiful profile, but not any of yours," <M>pointing to a lovely face in the branches of a dark cypress, which had not been before observed</M>.</DiaM>

The countess looked long and intently at it; but Madeline appeared not to hear what was going on, and flirted almost boisterously with Sydney and Mountstewart.

Percival looked over his aunt's shoulder, and suddenly became very pale. <DiaM>"Do you know the original?" <M>asked the countess</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Only as you do; we both remember the beautiful Hebe, removed from the picture-gallery at Alphington Castle, and hanging in that neglected suite of apartments."</Dia>

<Dia>"It is —- it must be the same."</Dia>

<DiaM>"My dear Madeline," <M>cried Catharine</M>, "come here, and tell us who is this mysterious face that your mamma and Percival are so intent over?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What fanciful nonsense! Why you will find all the allied sovereigns there directly. I declare the folly begins to grow troublesome. Give me the foolish thing; you shall not see it any more," <M>replied the confused beauty, as, hastily snatching the drawing, she ran from the room, but not before a look from her mother and Percival made her heartily repent the scheme she had before prided herself on having brought to perfection</M>.</DiaM></SceneDia>
