<ChapMarker>CHAPTER I.</ChapMarker>

IN the year 2126, England enjoyed peace and tranquillity under the absolute dominion of a female sovereign. Numerous changes had taken place for some centuries in the political state of the country, and several forms of government had been successively adopted and destroyed, till, as is generally the case after violent revolutions, they all settled down into an absolute monarchy. The religion of the country was mutable as its government; and in the end, by adopting Catholicism, it seemed to have arrived at nearly the same result: despotism in the state, indeed, naturally produces despotism in religion; the implicit faith and passive obedience required in the one case, being the best of all possible preparatives for the absolute submission of both mind and body necessary in the other.

In former times, England had been blessed with a mixed government and a tolerant religion, under which the people had enjoyed as much freedom as they perhaps ever can do, consistently with their prosperity and happiness. But <Sententia>it is not in the nature of the human mind, to be contented: we must always either hope or fear; and things at a distance appear so much more beautiful than they do when we approach them, that we always fancy what we have not, infinitely superior to any thing we have; and neglect enjoyments within our reach, to pursue others, which, like <i>ignes fatui</i>, elude our grasp at the very moment when we hope we have attained them.</Sententia>

Thus it was with the people of England: -— Not satisfied with being rich and prosperous, they longed for something more. Abundance of wealth caused wild schemes and gigantic speculations; and though many failed, yet, as some succeeded, the enormity of the sums gained by the projectors, incited others to pursue the same career. New countries were discovered and civilized; the whole earth was brought to the highest pitch of cultivation; every corner of it was explored; mountains were levelled, mines were excavated, and the globe racked to its centre. Nay, the air and sea did not escape, and all nature was compelled to submit to the overwhelming supremacy of Man.

Still, the English people were not satisfied: -— enabled to gratify every wish till satiety succeeded indulgence, they were still unhappy; perhaps, precisely because they had no longer any difficulties to encounter. Education became universal, and the technical terms of abstruse sciences familiar to the lowest mechanics; whilst questions of religion, politics, and metaphysics, agitated by them daily, supplied that stimulus, for which their minds, enervated by over cultivation, constantly craved. The consequences may be readily conceived. It was impossible for those to study deeply who had to labour for their daily bread; and not having time to make themselves masters of any given subject, they only learned enough of all to render them disputatious and discontented. Their heads were filled with words to which they affixed no definite ideas, and the little sense Heaven had blessed them with was lost beneath a mass of undigested and misapplied knowledge.

<Sententia>Conceit inevitably leads to rebellion</Sententia>. The natural consequence of the mob thinking themselves as wise as their rulers, was, that they took the first convenient opportunity that offered, to jostle these aforesaid rulers from their seats. An aristocracy was established, and afterwards a democracy; but both shared the same fate; for the leaders of each, in turn, found the instruments they had made use of to rise, soon become unmanageable. The people had tasted the sweets of power, they had learned their own strength, they were enlightened; and, fancying they understood the art of ruling as well as their quondam directors, they saw no reason why, after shaking off the control of one master, they should afterwards submit to the domination of many. <SpeechInsert>“We are free," <M>said they</M>; "We acknowledge no laws but those of nature, and of those we are as competent to judge as our would-be masters. In what are they superior to ourselves? Nature has been as bountiful to us as to them, and we have had the same advantages of education. Why then should we toil to give them ease? We are each capable of governing ourselves. Why should we pay them to rule us? Why should we be debarred from mental enjoyments and condemned to manual labour? Are not our tastes as refined as theirs, and our minds as highly cultivated? We will assert our independence, and throw off the yoke. If any man wish for luxuries, let him labour to procure them for himself. We will be slaves no longer; we will all be masters."</SpeechInsert>

Thus they reasoned, and thus they acted, till government after government having been overturned, complete anarchy prevailed; and the people began to discover, though, alas! too late, that there was little pleasure in being masters when there were no subjects; and that it was impossible to enjoy intellectual pleasures, whilst each man was compelled to labour for his daily bread. This was, however, inevitable, for, as perfect equality had been declared, of course no one would condescend to work for his neighbour; and every thing was done badly; as, however skilful any man may be in any particular art or profession, it is quite impossible he can excel in all.

In the meantime, the people, who had, though they scarcely knew why, attached to the idea of equality that of exemption from toil, found to their infinite surprise, that their burthens had increased tenfold, whilst their comforts had unaccountably diminished in the same proportion. The blessings of civilization were indeed fast slipping away from them. Every man became afraid lest the hard-earned means of existence should be torn from his grasp; for, as all laws had been abolished, the strong tyrannized over the weak, and the most enlightened nation in the world was in imminent danger of degenerating into a horde of rapacious barbarians.

This state of things could not continue; and the people, finding from experience that perfect equality was not quite the most enviable mode of government, began to suspect that a division of labour and a distinction of ranks were absolutely necessary to civilization; and sought out their ancient nobility, to endeavour to restore something like order to society. These illustrious personages were soon found: those who had not emigrated, had retired to their seats in the country, where, surrounded by their dependants, and the few friends who had remained faithful to them, they enjoyed the <i>otium cum dignitate</i>, and consoled themselves for the loss of their former greatness, by railing most manfully at those who had deprived them of it.

Amongst this number, was the lineal descendant of the late royal family, and to him the people now resolved humbly and unconditionally to offer the crown; imagining, with the usual vehemence and inconsistency of popular commotions, that an arbitrary government must be best for them, as being the very reverse of that, the evils of which they had just so forcibly experienced.

The prince however, to whom a deputation from the people made this offer, happened not to be ambitious. <Metaphor>Like another Cincinnatus</Metaphor>, he placed all his happiness in the cultivation of a small farm, and had sufficient prudence to reject a grandeur which he felt must be purchased by the sacrifice of his peace. The deputies were in despair at his refusal; and they re-urged their suit with every argument the distress of their situation could inspire. <SceneQuasi>They painted in glowing colours the horrors of the anarchy that prevailed, the misery of the kingdom, the despair of the people, and at last wound up their arguments by a solemn appeal to Heaven, that if he persisted in his refusal, the future wretchedness of the people might fall upon his head. The prince continued inexorable; and the deputies were preparing to withdraw, when the prince's daughter, who had been present during the whole interview, rushed forward and prevented their retreat: -— <DiaM>"Stay! I will be your Queen," <M>cried she energetically</M>; "I will save my country, or perish in the attempt!"</DiaM>

The princess was a beautiful woman, about six-and-twenty; and at this moment, her fine eyes sparkling with enthusiasm, her cheeks glowing, and her whole face and figure breathing dignity from the exalted purpose of her soul, she appeared to the deputies almost as a supernatural being; and, regarding her offer as a direct inspiration from Heaven, they bore her in triumph to the assembled multitude who awaited their return: whilst the people, ever caught by novelty, and desirous of any change to free them from the misery they were enduring, hailed her appearance with delight, and unanimously proclaimed her Queen.</SceneQuasi>

The new sovereign soon found the task she had undertaken a difficult one; but happening luckily to possess common sense and prudence, united with a firm and active disposition, she contrived in time to restore order, and to confirm her own power, whilst she contributed to the happiness of her people. The face of the kingdom rapidly changed -— security produced improvement -— and the self-banished nobles of the former dynasty crowding round the new Queen, she chose from amongst them the wisest and most experienced for her counsellors, and by their help compounded an excellent code of laws. This book was open to the whole kingdom; and cases being decided by principle instead of precedent, litigation was almost unknown: for as the laws were fully and clearly explained, so as to be understood by every body, few dared to act in open violation of them, punishment being certain to follow detection; and all the agonizing delights of a lawsuit were entirely destroyed, as every body knew, the moment the facts were stated, how it would inevitably terminate. This renewal of the golden age continued several years without interruption, the people being too much delighted with the personal comforts they enjoyed, to complain of the errors inseparable from all human institutions; whilst the remembrance of what they had suffered during the reign of anarchy, made them tremble at a change, and patiently submit to trifling inconveniences to avoid the risk of positive evils.

This generation passed away, and with it died, not only the recollection of the past misfortunes of the kingdom, but also the spirit of content they had engendered. A new race arose, who, with the ignorance and presumption of inexperience, found fault with every thing they did not understand, and accused the Queen and her ministers of dotage, merely because they did not accomplish impossibilities. The government, however, was too firmly established to be easily shaken. The judicious economy of the Queen had filled her treasury with riches; her prudent regulations had extended the commerce of her subjects to an almost incredible extent; whilst her firm and decided disposition made her universally respected both at home and abroad. The malcontents were therefore awed into submission, and obliged, in spite of themselves, to rest satisfied with growling at the government they were not strong enough to overturn. At this time the Queen died, and the state of affairs experienced an important change.

It has been before mentioned, that the religion of the country had altered with its government. Atheism, rational liberty, and fanaticism, had followed each other in regular succession; and the people found, by fatal experience, that persecution and bigotry assimilated as naturally with infidelity as with superstition. A fixed government seemed to require an established religion; and the multitude, ever in extremes, rushed from excess of liberty to intolerance. The Catholic faith was restored, new saints were canonized, and confessors appointed in the families of every person of distinction. These priests, however, were far from having the power they had possessed in former times. The eyes of men had been too long opened to be easily closed again. Education still continued amongst the lower classes; and though, at the time this history commences, it was going out of fashion with persons of rank, its influence was felt even by those most prejudiced against it. During the reign of the late Queen, the minds of the public not having any state affairs to occupy them, had been directed to the improvement of the arts and sciences; and so many new inventions had been struck out, so many wonderful discoveries made, and so many ingenious contrivances put into execution, that poor Nature seemed to be degraded from her throne, and usurping man to have stepped up to supply her place.

Before the Queen died, she chose her niece Claudia to succeed her; and as she enacted that none of her successors should marry, she ordered that all future queens should be chosen, by the people, from such female members of her family as might be between twenty and twenty-five years of age, at the time of the throne's becoming vacant. Every male throughout the kingdom who had attained the age of twenty-one, was to have a voice in this election; but as it was presumed it might be inconvenient to convoke these numerous electors into one place, it was agreed that every ten thousand should choose a deputy to proceed to London to represent them, and that a majority of these deputies should elect the Queen. It seemed probable to thinking minds, however, that this scheme, like most feasible in theory, would present some difficulties when it was to be put in practice; but of these, the old Queen never troubled herself to think. She had provided against any immediate disturbance by choosing her own successor, and she left posterity to take care of itself.

Queen Claudia was one of those <i>fainéant</i> sovereigns of whom it is extremely difficult to write the history, for the simple but unanswerable reason, that they never perform any action worthy of being recorded. But as she seldom did any harm, though she did not do much good, she contrived to escape either violent censure or applause; and in short, to get through life very decently, without making much bustle about it. She continued the same counsellors that had been employed by her predecessor, appointing the sons, when the fathers died, to save trouble. She left the laws as she found them for the same reason; and, in short, she let the affairs of government go on so quietly, and so exactly in the same routine as before, that for two or three years after her accession, the people were scarcely aware that any change had taken place.

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER II.</ChapMarker>

THE indolent Claudia had already reigned three years in the most profound tranquillity; and the year 2127 was beginning also to roll placidly away, when early in its spring the peace of the kingdom was interrupted, and the Council of the Queen thrown into most distressing consternation by the intelligence that Roderick, King of Ireland, had landed in Wales, at the head of an invading army, and that the malcontents from every part of the kingdom were flocking to his standard.

The crisis was alarming. The pacific reign of the late Queen, and inertness of the present one, had occasioned the standing army of England to be a splendid toy, kept rather for show than use; and universal education had made its component parts reasoning pedants, rather than active agents. It was, indeed, no uncommon occurrence to see a regiment thrown into confusion on a review day, in consequence of the orders of the general not exactly coinciding with the notions entertained of military tactics by the privates, who, whilst arguing the point, quite forgot what they had been ordered to perform. Little could reasonably be expected from an army thus constituted, but the native spirit of Englishmen, and their hatred of foreigners, rose triumphant over every obstacle; and the soldiers unanimously professed themselves ready to obey the orders of the council, and to die in defence of their Queen and government if necessary.

Unfortunately, however, the Council were in no condition to give orders. This worthy and sapient body had hitherto contrived to manage their affairs very comfortably, by referring in all cases of doubt and difficulty to decisions made in the reign of the late Queen; but this case was quite unprecedented, and the illustrious lawgivers were consequently completely at a loss as to what was best to be done. Meanwhile the enemy, who had no such scruples to contend with, entered the suburbs of London, and attacking the Queen's palace in Hammersmith Street, upon the banks of the Thames, would inevitably have taken her Majesty prisoner, had not this fatal outrage been prevented by the courage and activity of Edmund Montagu, a captain in the Queen's body guard, who had obtained his commission through the interest of the Queen's great uncle, the old Duke of Cornwall, only a short time previously.

This youthful hero luckily had command of the guard at the time of the enemy's attack, and by his decision and presence of mind, he succeeded in animating his soldiers to defend the post committed to their charge, till a body of regular troops under the Duke of Exeter, a veteran officer of the late Queen, came to their relief, and compelled the invaders to retreat.

The Duke of Exeter was a good soldier, and a sensible man. He saw the danger of his country, and like another Washington, left his beloved retirement to save it from destruction. The counsellors of the Queen gladly submitted to his dictation. They felt their own weakness, and cheerfully gave up the reins of government to hands better qualified to guide them. The Queen was equally glad to escape all responsibility; and the Duke of Exeter, appointing young Montagu, with whose conduct he had been much pleased, second in command, soon, by a succession of vigorous and consistent measures, drove the enemy from the kingdom: their retreat indeed being hastened by the news Roderick received of an insurrection having broken out in Dublin during his absence.

Whilst these intestine commotions were agitating England, the Emperors of Greece and Germany, who had long envied the prosperity of <QuotesOther>"the little sea-girt isle,"</QuotesOther> took the opportunity of declaring war against it; and Claudia only found herself freed from domestic foes, to contend with foreign ones. Her army, however, encouraged by success, professed themselves ready to encounter any enemy, and they set off for Germany, in high spirits under the command of General Montagu; the Duke of Exeter's age and infirmities making him decline leaving England.

<ChPortrait>The youthful general was the son of a baronet in the West of England, and rapid as his promotion had been at court, it was by no means greater than he deserved. His face and figure were such as the imagination delights to picture as a hero of antiquity; and his character accorded well with the majestic graces of his person. Haughty and commanding in his temper -— ambition was his God, and the love of glory his strongest passion; yet his very pride had a nobleness in it, and his soldiers loved though they feared him.</ChPortrait>

<ChPortrait>Very different was the character of his younger brother Edric, whose romantic disposition and contemplative turn of mind often excited the ridicule of his friends. As usual, in similar cases, the persecution he endured only wedded him more firmly to his peculiar opinions, and determined him to sustain them with the constancy of a martyr, whilst he secluded himself from society, and despised the opinion of the world, because he found it was against him; supposing himself capable of resisting every species of temptation, simply because, as yet, he had met with nothing adequate to tempt him.</ChPortrait> Older and more experienced persons have made the same mistake.

Perhaps the striking difference perceptible in the character of these young men, might be occasioned more by education than nature. Until the period of Edmund's obtaining his commission, they had both resided entirely at the country seat of their father, Sir Ambrose, where the care of their instruction was confided to Dr. Entwerfen, a German enthusiast, whom an unlucky propensity for trying experiments had banished from his native land. This philosopher, however, was unfortunately better skilled in the knowledge of the sciences, than in that of the human heart; and the lofty spirit of Edmund, despising his control, soon sought a more congenial companion in Father Morris, confessor to the Duke of Cornwall, who resided in the neighbourhood; and who, having been a warrior in his youth, was well calculated to sympathise with the feelings of a young aspirant for military glory.

The confessor was an intelligent, well informed man, and feeling flattered by the fondness Edmund showed for his society, he devoted all his leisure hours to the instruction of his young friend, leaving Dr. Entwerfen to occupy himself entirely with Edric, whose disposition accorded better with his own. Sir Ambrose was well satisfied with the change; Edmund was always his favourite son, and possessing the happy privilege of favourites, found no difficulty in persuading his father that whatever he preferred, was the best and most prudent plan that could possibly have been adopted. He thus easily contrived in due time to get permission to enter the army, and being naturally ardent and enterprising, success had hitherto attended all his efforts.

<AuthorialObservation>Country gentlemen have always been allowed to form a genus perfectly distinct from every other class of the community; there being something in the mere circumstance of a man's living entirely upon his own estate, which never fails to produce a peculiar effect upon the mind. An English 'Squire is indeed almost a petty monarch: surrounded by his tenants and dependants, he rarely, except upon occasions of ceremony, meets with any superior, or even equal to himself; and he becomes the sun of his own system, around whom the doctor, the parson, and the lawyer of his village, roll as attendant planets.</AuthorialObservation>

Notwithstanding all the changes that had taken place in the political, moral, and religious state of England, this caste remained the same; and Sir Ambrose was as warm in his feelings; as hasty in his temper, and as violent in his prejudices as any of his predecessors. He was nevertheless far superior to the generality of his class, and amongst innumerable other good qualities, was an indulgent master and an affectionate father. His foible, -— <Sententia>for alas! where shall we find a character without one</Sententia>, -— was a desire to show occasionally how implicitly he could be obeyed: though, in general, he was easy to a fault, and it was only when roused by opposition, that the natural obstinacy of his disposition displayed itself. Edmund's military glory was flattering to his parental pride, and his eyes would glisten with delight at the bare mention of his darling's name.

In common with most persons of his class, Sir Ambrose Montagu considered regularity as a cardinal virtue; and in his own habits, he was as undeviating and exact as the machinery which performed the principal domestic operations in his mansion. Every day after dinner at the same hour, he proceeded regularly to his library, where Abelard, an old butler, who had grown grey in his service, as regularly presented him with a splendid hookah, which he smoked with infinite satisfaction; whilst Davis, his steward, reported all that had occurred relative to the affairs of the farm during the day, and received orders all that was to take place during the morrow.

<SceneAction><Trigger>One fine evening in June, </Trigger>, Davis was not listened to with the accustomed interest; and the smoke of the hookah, instead of being gently puffed out with its usual air of calm enjoyment, rose rapidly in volumes, or sank entirely away, as Sir Ambrose appeared alternately excited by strong feeling, or lost in meditation. Parental affection occasioned this unwonted agitation; letters had been received from Edmund, announcing him to be upon the eve of battle with an army far superior to his own, and the impatience with which the doating father expected intelligence of the event, may be easier imagined than described. Still the force of habit prevailed, and the accustomed hour found him with his faithful attendants, Davis and Abelard, at their usual posts in the library.

The worthy baronet was above seventy; and his long white hair hung in waving curls upon his shoulders, as he sat in his comfortable elastic arm-chair, leaning one elbow upon the table before him. His features had been very handsome, and his complexion still retained that look of health and clearness, which, in a green old age, is the sure indication of a well-spent life. His countenance, though intelligent, was unmarked by the traces of any stormy passions; the cares and troubles of life seemed to have passed gently over him, and content had smoothed the wrinkles age might have made upon his brow; whilst the tall thin figure of Mr. Davis, as he stood reverentially bending forward, his hat in his hand, and his whole demeanour expressing a singular mixture of preciseness and habitual respect, contrasted strongly with the dignified appearance of his master.

The windows of the library opened to the ground, and looked out upon a fine terrace, shaded by a verandah, supported by trelliswork, round which, twined roses mingled with vines. Below, stretched a smiling valley, beautifully wooded, and watered by a majestic river winding slowly along; now lost amidst the spreading foliage of the trees that hung over its banks, and then shining forth again in the light as a lake of liquid silver. Beyond, rose hills majestically towering to the skies, their clear outline now distinctly marked by the setting sun, as it slowly sank behind them, shedding its glowing tints of purple and gold upon their heathy sides; whilst some of its brilliant rays even penetrated through the leafy shade of the verandah, and danced like summer lightning upon the surface of a mirror of polished steel which hung directly in the face of Sir Ambrose.

<DiaM>"What a lovely evening!" <M>exclaimed the worthy baronet, gazing with a delightful eye upon the rich landscape before him</M>; "often as I have looked upon this scene, methinks every time I see it I discover some new beauty. How finely the golden tint the sun throws upon the tops of those trees, is relieved by the deep masses of shadow below! That was Edmund's favourite grove, poor fellow!" <Descriptor>and the anxious father sighed, as he puffed his hookah.</Descriptor></DiaM>

<DiaM>"It is a fine evening," <M>said Davis, bowing low</M>, “and if your honour pleases, I think we had better get the steam-mowing apparatus in motion to-morrow. If the sun should be as hot to-morrow as it has been to-day, I am sure the hay will make without using the burning glass at all."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Do as you like, Davis," <M>returned his master, puffing the smoke violently from his pipe</M>, "I leave it entirely to you."</DiaM>

<Dia>"And does not your honour think I had better give the barley a little rain? It will be all burnt up, if this weather should continue; and if your honour approve, it may be done immediately, for I saw a nice black heavy-looking cloud sailing by just now, and I can get the electrical machine out in five minutes to draw it down, if your honour thinks fit."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I have already told you I give you permission to do as you like, Davis," <M>returned the baronet, puffing out volumes of smoke from his hookah</M>. "Inundate the fields if you will, so that you don't trouble me any more about the matter."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But I would not wish to act without your honour's full conviction," <M>resumed the persevering steward</M>. "Your honour must be aware of the aridity of the soil, and of the impossibility that exists of a proper developement of the incipient heads, unless they be supplied with an adequate quantity of moisture."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You are very unreasonable, Davis," <M>said Sir Ambrose</M>; "most of your fraternity would be satisfied with being permitted to have their own way; but you --- "</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Excuse my interrupting your honour," <M>cried Davis, bowing profoundly</M>; "but I cannot bear it to be thought that I was capable of persuading your honour to take any steps your honour might not thoroughly approve. Now as to the germinization and ripening --- "</DiaM>

<DiaM>"My good fellow!" <M>exclaimed Sir Ambrose, smiling at the energy with which Davis spoke -— his thin figure waving backwards and forwards in the sunshine, and his earnest wish to convince his master, almost depriving his voice of its usual solemn and sententious tone</M>: "My mind is too much occupied to think of these things now, so I give you full and free liberty to burn, dry, or drown my fields, as you may think fit; empowering you to take all necessary steps, either to germinate or ripen corn upon any part of my estate, only premising, that you do not trouble me upon the subject any longer; and so good night."</DiaM>

This being spoken in a tone of voice Davis did not dare to disobey, he slowly retired, apparently as much annoyed at having his own way, as some people are at being contradicted; when suddenly a brilliant flash of light gleamed on the baronet's polished mirror. <DiaM>"Ah! what was that?" <M>exclaimed Sir Ambrose, starting up, and dashing his pipe upon the ground</M>.</DiaM>

He gazed eagerly upon the mirror for a few seconds in breathless anxiety, bending forwards in a listening attitude, and not daring to stir, as though he feared the slightest movement might destroy the pleasing illusion. The flash was repeated again and again in rapid succession, whilst a peal of silver bells began to ring their rounds in liquid melody. <DiaM>"Thank God! thank God!" <M>exclaimed the aged baronet, sinking upon his knees, and clasping his hands together, whilst the big tears rolled rapidly down his face</M>, "My Edmund has conquered! my Edmund is safe!"</DiaM>

The faithful servants of Sir Ambrose followed the example of their master, and for some minutes the whole party appeared lost in silent thanksgivings; the silver bells still continuing their harmonious sweetness, though in softer and softer strains, till at last they gradually died away upon the ear. Sir Ambrose started from his knees as the melody ceased, and desiring Abelard to summon Edric and Father Morris, who was then with the youthful philosopher in his study, <Blend>he rushed upon the terrace</Blend>, followed by Davis, to examine a telegraph placed upon a mount at a little distance, so as to be seen from one end of it: the light and music just mentioned, being a signal always given when some important information was about to be transmitted.

The sun had now sunk behind the hills, and the shades of evening were rapidly closing in as the baronet, with straining eyes, watched the various movements of the machine. <DiaM>"One, two, and six!" <M>said he</M>; "yes, that signifies he has won the battle, and is safe. My heart told me so, when I saw the signal flash. My darling Edmund! -— two, four, and eight -— he has subdued the Germans, and taken the whole of the fine province of France. Six, six, and four -— alas! my failing eyes are too weak to see distinctly. Davies, look I implore you! The signal is changing before we have discovered its meaning! For mercy's sake look before it be too late! Alas! alas! I had forgotten your eyes are as feeble as mine own. Oh, Davis! where is Edric? Why is not he here to assist his poor old father at such a moment as this?"</DiaM></SceneAction>

But Edric was otherwise engaged. After the departure of Edmund for the continent, the attention of Father Morris had been directed to his brother, and the mind of Edric, which had long craved for stronger food than it could obtain from the good-natured Dr. Entwerfen, expanded rapidly beneath the culture bestowed upon it. He had long been fond of abstract studies and visionary speculations, but they now formed the only pleasure of his existence; and he pursued them with an eagerness which made all the ordinary affairs of life appear tasteless and insipid. An idea, suggested by Father Morris in one of their conferences, as to the possibility of reanimating a dead body, took forcible possession of his mind. His imagination became heated by long dwelling upon the same theme; and a strange, wild, undefinable craving to hold converse with a disembodied spirit haunted him incessantly. For some time he buried this feverish anxiety in his own breast, and tried in vain to subdue it; but it seemed to hang upon his steps, to present itself before him wherever he went, and, in short, to pursue him with the malignancy of a demon. 

<SceneDia><DiaM>"What is the matter with you, Edric?" <M>said Father Morris to his proselyte, the day we have already mentioned.</M> "You are so changed, I scarcely know you, and your eyes have a wild expression, absolutely terrific."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I am, indeed, half mad," <M>returned Edric, with a melancholy smile</M>; "and yet, perhaps, you will laugh when I tell you the reason of my uneasiness: to say truth, the conversation we had together the other day has occasioned it. You convinced me so clearly of the possibility of resuscitating a dead body, that since that moment I have been tormented by an earnest desire to communicate with one who has been an inhabitant of the tomb. I would fain know the secrets of the grave, and ascertain whether the spirit be chained after death to its earthly covering of clay, condemned till the day of final resurrection to hover over the rotting mass of corruption that once contained it; or whether the last agonies of death free it from its mortal ties, and leave it floating, free as air, in the bright regions of ethereal space?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You know my opinion," <M>said the priest</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I do," <M>replied the pupil</M>; "but forgive me if I add -— I do not feel satisfied with it: in fact, mine is not a character to be satisfied with building my faith upon that of any other man. I would see and judge for myself."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I do not blame you," <M>resumed the Father Morris</M>; "a reasonable being should believe nothing he cannot prove; and to remove your doubts, I would advise you to step into the adjoining church-yard, where you can try Dr. Entwerfen's galvanic battery of fifty surgeon power, (which you must allow is surely enough to re-animate the dead,) upon a body which then --- "</DiaM>

<DiaM>“Hold! hold!" <M>cried Edric, shuddering</M>. "My blood freezes in my veins, at the thought of a church-yard: —- your words recall a horrible dream that I had last night, which, even now, dwells upon my mind, and resists all the efforts I can make to shake it off."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Tell it, then," <M>said the Confessor sternly</M>; "for when the imagination is possessed by horrible fantasies, it is relieved by speaking of them to another person."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I thought," <M>said Edric</M>, "that I was wandering in a thick gloomy wood, through which I had the utmost difficulty to make my way. The black trees, frowning in awful majesty above my head, twined together in masses, so as almost to obstruct my path. Suddenly, a fearful light flashed upon me, and I saw at my feet a horrid charnel house, where the dying mingled terrifically with the dead. The miserable living wretches turned and writhed with pain, striving in vain to escape from the mass of putrescence heaped upon them. I saw their eye-balls roll in agony -— I watched the distortion of their features, and, making a violent effort to relieve one who had almost crawled to my feet, I shrank back with horror as I found the arm I grasped soften to my touch, and a disgusting mass of corruption give way beneath my fingers! -— Shuddering I awoke —- a cold sweat hanging upon my brows, and every nerve thrilling with convulsive agony."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Mere visionary terrors," <M>said the father</M>. "You have suffered your imagination to dwell upon one subject, till it is become morbid."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Is it not strange," <M>continued Edric, apparently pursuing the current of his own thoughts</M>, "that the mind should crave so earnestly what the body shudders at; and yet, how can a mass of mere matter, which we see sink into corruption the moment the spirit is withdrawn from it, shudder? How can it even feel? I can scarcely analyse my own sensations; but it appears to me that two separate and distinct spirits animate the mass of clay which composes the human frame. The one, the merely vital spark which gives it life and motion, and which we share in common with brutes, and even vegetables; and the other, the divine ethereal spirit, which we may properly term the soul, and which is a direct emanation from God himself, only bestowed upon man."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"In my opinion," <M>said Father Morris</M>, "the organs of thought, reflection, imagination and reason, are material; and as long as the body remains uncorrupted all may be restored, provided circulation can be renewed: for that I think the principle essentially necessary to set the animal machine in motion."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I confess," <M>resumed Edric</M>, "we all know that circulation and the action of the lungs are inseparably connected, and that if the latter be arrested, death must ensue. How frequently are apparently dead bodies recovered by friction, which produces circulation; and inflation of the lungs with air, which restores their action. If the idea be correct, that the soul leaves the body the instant what we call death takes place, how can these instances of resuscitation be accounted for? Think you that the soul can be recalled to the body after it has once quitted it? Or that it hovers over it in air, attached to it by invisible ligatures, ready to be drawn back to its former situation, when the body shall resume its vital functions? It cannot surely remain in a dormant state, and be reawakened with the body; for this would be inconsistent with the very idea of an incorporeal spirit."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"If you could overcome your childish reluctance to trying an experiment upon a corpse," <M>said Father Morris</M>, "your doubts would be set at rest. For if you could succeed in re-animating a dead body that had been long entombed, so that it might enjoy its reasoning faculties in full perfection, my opinion would be completely established."</DiaM>

<Dia>"But where shall I find a body, which has been dead a sufficient time to prevent the possibility of its being only in a trance, and which yet has not begun to decompose? -— For even if I could conquer the repugnance I feel at the thought of touching such a mass of cold mortality, as that presented in my dream, according to your own theory, the organs must be perfect, or the experiment will not be complete."</Dia>

<Dia>"What think you of trying to operate upon a mummy? You know a chamber has been lately discovered in the great pyramid, which is supposed to be the real tomb of Cheops; and where, it is said, the mummies of that great king and the principal personages of his household, have been found in a state of wonderful preservation."</Dia>

<Dia>"But mummies are so swathed up."</Dia>

<Dia>"Not those of kings and princes. You know all travellers, both ancient and modern, who have seen them, agree, that they are wrapped merely in folds of red and white linen, every finger and even every toe distinct; thus, if you could succeed in resuscitating Cheops, you need not even touch the body; as the clothing in which it is wrapped, would not at all encumber its movements."</Dia>

<Dia>"The idea is feasible, and, as you rightly say, if it can be put into execution, will set the matter at rest for ever. I should also like to visit the pyramids, those celebrated monuments of antiquity, whose origin is lost in the obscurity of the darker ages, and which seem to have been spared by the devastating hand of Time, purposely to perplex the learned."</Dia>

Dr. Entwerfen had been present during the whole of this conversation, though he had been so busied with some philosophical experiments, that he had not joined in it; roused, however, by the word "pyramid," he now started forward.

<DiaM>“You are right," <M>cried he, with enthusiasm</M>, “they are, indeed, a mystery which it has puzzled ages to develope -— go to Egypt, and I will accompany you. I feel an inward voice call me to the spot. Yes, we will explore these monuments, and who can tell but that we may be the favoured mortals destined to raise the mystic veil which so long has covered them? We may be decreed to revive their mummies, and force them to reveal the secrets of their prison-house. It was Cheops raised the pyramids from the dust by science, and Cheops, by the force of science, shall be compelled to disclose their origin."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I am glad," <M>resumed Father Morris</M>, "to find the opinions of Dr. Entwerfen coincide so exactly with my own, and that he will have the kindness to accompany your expedition. You will want a companion who can enter into your feelings, and participate in your hopes. My monastic vows chain me to this spot, or I would gladly lend my humble aid to accomplish so valuable a discovery."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Well, well, we can easily fancy that," cried Dr. Entwerfen, impatiently; "but though you can't go, we can: and -— and -— when shall we set off, Edric, dear?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Stay, stay!" <M>replied Edric, smiling at the doctor's impetuosity</M>; "though I own I should like to visit Egypt, yet there are many things to be considered before such an expedition can be undertaken. I must obtain my father's consent. I must --- "</DiaM>

Here a gentle tap at the door interrupted Edric's argument; and made the doctor, whose nerves were rather susceptible, leap two or three yards in a fright: -- whilst Father Morris, with his usual air of calm composure, opened the door to the unwelcome intruder.

<ArrivalDeparture>It was old Abelard the butler.</ArrivalDeparture> Half ashamed of the unphilosophic terror he had evinced, the doctor felt glad to be able to hide his emotion under the appearance of anger, and demanded peevishly, what was the matter. <DiaM>"Have I not told you a hundred times," <M>continued he</M>, "that I do not like to be interrupted at my studies! and that nothing is more disagreeable than to have one's attention distracted, when it has been fixed upon an affair of importance!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I do not attempt to controvert the axiom you have just propounded," <M>returned Abelard, speaking in a slow precise manner, <Metaphor>as though he weighed every syllable before he drawled it forth</Metaphor></M>: "for undeniable facts do not admit of contradiction. However, as the message with which I stand charged at the present moment, relates to Master Edric and the reverend Father Morris, instead of yourself, I humbly opine, no blame can attach itself to me, on account of the unpremeditated interruption of which you allege me culpable."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And what have you to say to me?" <M>demanded Edric</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"That the worthy gentleman, your respectable progenitor, requests you instantly to put in exercise your locomotive powers to join him on the terrace, to the end, that there your superior visual faculties may afford <i>soulagement</i> to the mental anxiety under which he at present labours, by aiding him to develope the intelligence conveyed to him by the telegraphic machine."</Dia>

<DiaM>"What!" <M>exclaimed Edric, eagerly, and then, without waiting a reply, he darted forward, and in a few seconds was by the side of his father: whilst Father Morris followed with nearly equal expedition</M>.</DiaM>

Abelard gazed after them with amazement: <DiaM>"There is something very astonishing," <M>said he, addressing Dr. Entwerfen</M>, "in the effervescence of the animal spirits during youth. I labour under a complete acatalepsy upon the subject; I should think it must arise from the excessive elasticity of the nerves. Ideas strike -— "</DiaM> but here, happening unfortunately to look up, he too was struck to find Dr. Entwerfen had also vanished: and being unwilling to waste his eloquence upon the empty air, he departed, slowly and solemnly, however, according to his custom, to <Blend>join the party assembled on the terrace.</Blend>

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER III.</ChapMarker>

<DiaM>"MY dear Edric," <M>exclaimed Sir Ambrose, throwing himself into the arms of his son,</M> "my dear, dear Edric! your brother has gained the battle! The Germans are completely overthrown. He has taken their king, and several of their princes prisoners; and the fine province of France is ceded to us entirely!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I am rejoiced to hear it," <M>cried Edric, returning his father's embrace with emotion</M>, "and he, I hope, is safe?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I hope so too," <M>replied Sir Ambrose</M>; "though he says nothing of himself: but you know Edmund: <CharacterDiction>'Our troops won this,' 'our army gained that!' ‘the soldiers fought bravely!'</CharacterDiction> he never speaks of himself. To hear him relate a battle, nobody would imagine he had ever had any thing to do with it."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It is too dark to see any more," <M>said Father Morris, who, during this conversation, had been watching the telegraph, and now turned from it in despair</M>; "the machine is still in motion, but it is too dark for me to decipher what it means."</DiaM>

The attention of all present was directed to the sky as he spoke. It was indeed become of pitchy blackness, a general gloom seemed to hang over the face of nature; the birds flew twittering for shelter, a low wind moaned through the trees, and, in short, every thing seemed to portend a storm.

<DiaM>"Had we not better return to the house?" <M>said Dr. Entwerfen, looking round with something like fear at these alarming indications, for his heated imagination had not yet quite recovered the effect of the awful speculations in which he had been so lately indulging</M>. "What is that black spot there? I declare it moves! Good heavens! what can it be?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Really, doctor!" <M>returned Abelard</M>, "you provoke the action of my risible faculties. That opaque body which you perceive at a little distance, and which seems to have occasioned such a fearful excitement of your nervous system, is only a living specimen of the corvus genus, who has probably descended upon earth to search for his vermicular repast."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I beg your pardon, Mr. Abelard," <M>rejoined Mr. Davis, speaking with his usual precision</M>, "but, according to my humble apprehension, you labour under a slight mistake as to that particular. The feathered biped that has so forcibly attracted your attention, appears to me, not one of the corvi, but rather one of the graculi; a variety of extremely rare occurrence in this vicinity, and which are sometimes called incendriæ aves, from their unfortunate propensity to put habitations in combustion, by picking up small pieces of phlogisticated carbon, and carrying them in their beaks to the combination of straw and other materials, sometimes piled upon the apex of a house, to defend it from the inroads of pluviosity."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It is of no use," <M>sighed Sir Ambrose, still straining his eyes to endeavour to decipher the movements of the telegraph, the outlines of which now only appeared, stamped as if in jet, and strongly relieved by the dark grey sky beyond.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"It is of no use," <M>reiterated Father Morris</M>, <Descriptor>and the whole party were preparing to retire, when suddenly a vivid light flashed upon them from the hill, and instantly a long line of torches seemed to stream along the horizon</Descriptor>.</DiaM> <DiaM>"He is coming home, but will write more tomorrow," <M>exclaimed the whole party simultaneously; for all knew well by experience, the meaning of that signal</M>.</DiaM> <DiaM>"He is coining home, thank God!" <M>repeated Sir Ambrose, his pallid lips quivering, and every limb trembling with agitation</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Look to my father," <M>cried Edric</M>, "he will faint."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh no, no!" <M>repeated Sir Ambrose</M>: "thank God! thank God!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Lean upon me, at least," <M>said Edric, affectionately</M>.</DiaM>

Sir Ambrose complied; and, supported by his son, gazed anxiously on the torches, the red glare of which, by shedding an unnatural light around them, made the surrounding darkness only appear more intense. Thunder now growled in the distance, and rain began to fall in large drops; yet still Sir Ambrose stood, with his eyes fixed upon the torches, and no persuasions could induce him to leave the terrace. These wild, fearful-looking lights, gleaming through the tempest, seemed a connecting link between him and his darling son; and it was not till they were obscured by the thick heavy rain, and even the outline of the telegraph vanished in the gathering clouds around, that he could be induced to seek for shelter.</SceneDia>

Sir Ambrose slept little that night: the sleep of age is easily broken, and perhaps the joyful agitation of his spirits had produced a slight access of fever. <SceneDia>He rose with the dawn; and, long before the rest of his family had descended, summoned Abelard, that he might dispatch him to inform the Duke of Cornwall of the news: as Father Morris, on account of the storm, had passed the night at the house of Sir Ambrose.

<DiaM>"Go," <M>said he, as soon as the drowsy butler made his appearance</M>. "I am sure the duke feels nearly as great an interest in the success of Edmund as myself, and will not be displeased if he be disturbed a little earlier than usual upon such an occasion."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I obey," <M>replied Abelard</M>. "I will shake off my somnolent propensities, and speed with the velocity of the electric fluid to the castle of the noble chieftain."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Take heed you do not forget your message by the way," <M>repeated Sir Ambrose, smiling</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Not all the waters of Lethe could wash such somnifugous tidings from my memory," <M>replied the butler</M>. "Your honour's words are imprinted upon the mnemonic organ of my brain; and my sensorium must be divided from my cerebellum ere they can be effaced."</DiaM></SceneDia>

The Duke of Cornwall had been the intimate friend of Sir Ambrose almost from infancy. They had been companions at school and at college; besides which, peculiar circumstances which had happened in their youth, had linked them together in indissoluble ties. What these circumstances were, however, no one exactly knew, except the parties concerned, and they always avoided alluding to them. All that was generally understood upon the subject being, that Sir Ambrose had, in some manner, been instrumental in saving the duke's life; but how, when, or where, was never clearly explained.

<ChBioIntro>The Duke of Cornwall was of the royal family of England, and closely allied to the throne. His father had been brother to that prince who had so stedfastly refused the crown when it was offered to him by the ambassadors from the people; and as that prince had left no male descendants, the duke might be considered as legitimately entitled to reign. The thought of disturbing by his claims the female dynasty now established, had, however, never entered into his mind, for having taken it into his head that he would marry his daughter Elvira to Edmund Montagu, and his niece Rosabella to Edric, he turned all his thoughts, plans, and wishes to the accomplishment of this object, and suffered no other idea to interfere with it.</ChBioIntro>

Like most persons living in complete retirement, the duke was exceedingly fond of petty mysteries and needless manœuvres, and he wasted as much ingenuity and as many contrivances over this scheme, as might, if differently applied, have sufficed to overturn a kingdom. It was true, the interest of the plot was somewhat spoiled, by the fear that the instant he made known his intentions, every one would be delighted to comply with them: yet still, as long as it was kept secret, it was a plot, and as it was the best the duke could muster, he resolved to make the most of it.

For this purpose he made Father Morris his confidant, and held long private conferences every day with him upon the subject. The duke was now completely happy: he had not only something to plan, and something to think about, but he had also some one to oppose, for Father Morris's opinion as to the dispositions of the young people, was diametrically opposite to his own; he thinking the strong mind and haughty spirit of Rosabella better suited to the ambitious Edmund, whilst the soft yielding disposition and feminine graces of Elvira seemed to harmonize exactly with the taste of the philosophic Edric. No persuasions, however, could induce the duke to deviate in the slightest degree from his design. Like many of the higher classes of society in those days of universal education, he affected an excessive plainness and simplicity in his language; so much so, indeed, as sometimes almost to degenerate into rudeness, in order that it might be clearly distinguished from the elaborate and scientific expressions of the vulgar; and when urged by his confessor upon the subject of these intended marriages, he would roughly say, <SpeechHabitual>"Don't talk to me; there is nothing like a little contradiction in the married life. If two people were to agree to live together, who were always of the same opinion, they would die of ennui in six months. No, no, I'm right, and so they'll find it in the end."</SpeechHabitual>

He would then shake his head, and put on such a look of positive determination, that Father Morris would generally retire in silence, feeling it perfectly in vain to attempt to alter his resolution. As to consulting the inclinations of the young people themselves, the idea never entered his imagination. <SpeechHabitual>"Children don't know what is good for them," <M>he would reply sharply, if such a thought were suggested to him</M>, "and it is the duty of parents and guardians to decide in such matters."</SpeechHabitual>

<SceneDia>The duke had already risen, and was in his garden, <Trigger>when</Trigger> the messenger of Sir Ambrose arrived panting for breath, and quite exhausted by the velocity, as he expressed it, which he had employed in endeavouring to execute with the utmost expedition, the wishes of his master. The duke was surprised to see him. -— <DiaM>"What brings you out so early, Abelard?" <M>demanded he</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, your grace," <M>replied the butler, gasping for utterance</M>, "the haste I have made has impeded my respiration; and the blood, finding the pulmonary artery free, rushes with such force along the arterial canal to the aorta, that -— that -— I am in imminent danger of being suffocated."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Pshaw!" <M>said the duke</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Besides," <M>continued Abelard</M>, "a saline secretion distils from every pore of my skin, in a serous transudation, from the excessive exertions I have made use of."</DiaM>

<Dia>"And what has occasioned these violent exertions?"</Dia>

<Dia>"The earnest desire experienced by Sir Ambrose to transmit with all the expedition possible, to your grace, the intelligence he has just received of the acquisition of a victory by Master Edmund, in the hostile territory of Germany."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Victory!" <M>shouted the duke</M>, "Victory! -— Rosabella! Elvira! where are you, girls? Here's tidings to rouse you from your slumbers. —- And how is he, Abelard? Is the brave boy safe himself? God bless him! victory will be nothing to us, if we are to lose him."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It occasions me excessive chagrin," <M>replied Abelard</M>, "that I am totally unable to resolve that interrogatory to your grace's complete satisfaction. Taciturnity, however, upon some subjects, is, I believe, generally considered synonymous with prosperity; and, as Master Edmund, to the best of my credence, conveyed no information relative to his sanity in the communication made by him to his paternal ancestor, I humbly opine that there are no reasonable grounds for supposing it has suffered any material deterioration in consequence of the late sanguinary encounter in which he has been engaged."</DiaM>

The duke had not patience to wait the conclusion of this speech; but hobbled away as fast as his infirmities would permit, vociferating for Elvira and Rosabella, in a voice that might have silenced Stentor; and Abelard, finding himself alone, was fain to follow his example, marvelling as he went along, at the excessive impatience of the fiery spirits of the age, which would not permit people to remain stationary, even to hear, what he called, a compendious replication to the very questions which they themselves had propounded.</SceneDia>

Whatever faults might fall to the share of the Duke of Cornwall, that of a cold heart was certainly not amongst the number, and the delight he felt on hearing of Edmund's triumph could not have been greater if the youthful hero had been his own son. His eyes, indeed, absolutely sparkled with transport, when he communicated the intelligence to his niece and daughter; and his tidings were not bestowed upon insensible ears, for the breasts of both his youthful auditors throbbed with pleasure at the news. Elvira had been the idol of Edmund's homage from her childhood; and she fancied she returned his passion with equal fervour; but she deceived herself, and love was as yet a stranger to her heart. Endowed with great beauty and superior talents; accustomed from her earliest infancy to be worshipped by all around her; surrounded by flatterers, till even flattery had lost its charm, Elvira had yet never loved; why she had not, we leave to philosophers to explain; we merely state facts and leave others to draw conclusions.

Rosabella's character was much more easy to decipher than that of her cousin. Passion was the essence of her existence; and her dark eyes flashed a fire that bespoke the intensity of her feelings. She loved Edmund, but though she loved him with all that overwhelming violence, which only a soul like hers could feel, yet she would not have scrupled to sacrifice even him to her revenge, if she had thought he treated her with negligence or contempt. She scorned the opinion of the world, and regarded mankind in general but as slaves, whom she should honour by trampling beneath her feet. Ambition was her leading passion, and even her love for Edmund struggled in vain for mastery against it. This feeling was now highly gratified by the tidings of Edmund's victory. She triumphed in his glory; and a deeper glow burnt upon her cheek, from the proud consciousness she felt that she had not placed her affections upon an unworthy object.

<SceneAction><DiaM>"We have no time to lose, girls," <M>said the duke</M>. "I would not miss being with Sir Ambrose when he receives his letter, for kingdoms. Here, Hyppolite! Augustus! get a balloon ready, and let us be off directly. How tedious these fellows are! They might have removed a church steeple in the time they have wasted about that balloon."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"If your grace would have a moment's patience," <M>said Hyppolite, holding the cords of the balloon</M>.</DiaM> But his Grace had no patience; it was an ingredient Nature had quite forgotten to put into his composition; and, without waiting for the ascending ladder to be put down, he sprang into the car in such haste the moment the balloon was brought to the door, that he was in imminent danger of oversetting it. <DiaM>"So! so," <M>said he</M>, "very well! that will do, -— and now girls, that you are safely embarked, we will be off. Hyppolite! you will steer us: -- and, Abelard, go you into the buttery, and let my fellows give you something to eat; you will want something after your fatigues. There! there, that will do; don't let us hinder a moment --- ;" <Descriptor>and the rest of his speech was lost in air, as the balloon floated majestically away</Descriptor>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It has often appeared very astonishing to me," <M>said Abelard, <ArrivalDeparture>after watching the balloon till it was out of sight</ArrivalDeparture></M>, "to observe how partial great people are generally to an aërial mode of travelling; for my part, I think the pedestrian manner infinitely more agreeable."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"<i>De gustibus non est disputandum</i>" <M>replied Augustus, the duke's footman, to whom this observation was addressed</M>: -— "But I think I observe symptoms of lassitude about you, Mr. Abelard. Will you not adjourn to the apartment of Mrs. Russel, our housekeeper, to repair by some alimentary refreshment, the excessive exhaustion you have sustained in the course of your morning's exertions?"</DiaM>

<Dia>"Willingly, Mr. Augustus. -— I own candidly, I feel the want of a little wholesome nutrition. I shall, besides, be extremely happy to avail myself of the opportunity fortune so benignantly presents, of paying my respects to Mrs. Russel, whom I have not seen these three days."</Dia>

The worthy housekeeper was equally rejoiced with Abelard at this instance of Fortune's benignity; a sort of sentimental flirtation having been going on between them for the last thirty years. She accordingly stroked down her snow-white apron, re-adjusted her mob cap, and smoothed her grey hairs, which were divided upon her forehead, with the most scrupulous exactness, before she advanced to welcome her visitors. <DiaM>"What will you take, my dear Mr. Abelard?" <M>said she, as soon as he was within hearing</M>; "what can you fancy? I have a delicious corner of a cold venison pasty in my pantry."</DiaM>

<DiaM>“Words are altogether too feeble to express the transports of my gratitude at receiving so gracious an accolade, beauteous Eloisa," <M>replied the romantic butler; for thus, in allusion to his own name, was he wont to call her.</M> "But though you had only the rigours of the Paraclete to invite me to, instead of the comforts of your well-stored pantry, still would words be wanting to express the feelings of my bosom on thus again beholding you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Spare my blushes!" <M>said Mrs. Russel, casting her eyes upon the ground, and playing with a corner of her apron</M>. "I feel a roseate suffusion glow upon my cheeks, as your flattering accents strike upon the tympanum of my auricular organs."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, Mrs. Russel!" <M>sighed Abelard, gazing upon her tenderly; -- then, after a short pause, he continued</M>: "As to the aliments with which your provident kindness would soulage my appetite -- though venison be a wholesome viand, and was reckoned by the ancients efficacious in preventing fevers, and though the very mention of the savoury pasty makes the eryptæ, usually employed in secreting the mucus of my tongue, erect themselves, thereby occasioning an overflow of the saliva, yet will I deny myself the indulgence, and content myself simply with a boiled egg, as being more likely to agree with the present enfeebled state of the digestive organs of my stomach."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You shall have it instantly," <M>cried Mrs. Russel</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And will you have the kindness to superintend the culinary arrangement of it yourself?" <M>rejoined Abelard.</M>  "I do not like the albumen too much coagulated; and I prefer it without any butyraceous oil, simply flavoured by the addition of a small quantity of common muriate of soda."</DiaM>

The egg was soon prepared and devoured. <DiaM>"Thank you, thank you! dear Mrs. Russell," <M>said Abelard</M>; "this refection was most acceptable. I had felt for some time the gastric juice corroding the coats of my stomach; and still, though I have now given it some solid substance to act upon, I think it would not be amiss to dilute its virulence by the addition of a little fluid. Have you any thing cool and refreshing?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have some bottled beer," <M>replied Mrs. Russel</M>; "but I am afraid the carbonic acid gas has not been sufficiently disengaged during the process of the vinous fermentation to render it wholesome; and there is scarcely any alcohol in the whole composition --- "</DiaM>

<DiaM>That is exactly what I want," <M>said Abelard</M>; "for my physicians have expressly forbidden stimulants. Provided the gluten that forms the germ was properly separated in the preparation of the malt, and the seed sufficiently germinated to convert the fecula into sugar, I shall be perfectly satisfied."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I can guarantee the accuracy of its preparation both with regard to the malt and the beer," <M>repeated Mrs. Russel</M>; and the frothing fluid soon sparkled in a goblet, to the infinite satisfaction of the thirsty butler, who, after a hearty draught, vowed nectar itself was never half so delicious; and that all the gods on Olympus would envy him, if they could but taste his fare, and see the blooming Hebe that was his cup-bearer.</DiaM></SceneAction>

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER IV.</ChapMarker>

<SceneAction>When the balloon of the duke approached the habitation of Sir Ambrose, its occupiers perceived the worthy baronet walking with hasty strides towards the mount of the telegraph, which commanded an extensive view of the surrounding country, followed by Edric, Father Morris, and Dr. Entwerfen, who appeared vainly endeavouring to persuade him to relax a speed so little suited to his advanced years.

<DiaM>"Talk not to me of going slowly, when I expect news of my darling Edmund!" <M>exclaimed Sir Ambrose, continuing his rapid pace —- his heart beating with paternal pride, and his countenance beaming with exultation</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>“I am also anxious to hear of my brother," <M>said Edric</M>, "but after the information we have already received by the telegraphic dispatch, it appears to me that we have little more to learn of importance."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Edric, you are not a father, and you can have no idea of a father's anxiety," <M>replied Sir Ambrose, hurrying on to the mount, <Metaphor>as though he hoped the rapidity of his motion would afford some relief to the impatience of his mind</Metaphor></M>; <Descriptor>whilst the party of the duke, seeing the point to which he was hastening, opened the valves of their balloon, and made preparations to descend upon the same spot</Descriptor>.</DiaM>

The duke and Sir Ambrose were always glad to meet, but as the present occasion was one of more than ordinary interest, so they now greeted each other with more than ordinary pleasure. The duke had always been warmly attached to Edmund, and his voice actually trembled with agitation as he exclaimed: --

<DiaQ>"Well, my old friend, you see your brave boy is determined to keep us alive still. Our blood would stagnate in our veins, if he did not give us a fillip now and then to rouse us. But what does the young rogue say of himself? I hope he's not wounded?"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>“He never mentions himself," <M>replied Ar Ambrose, tears glistening in his eyes, as he pressed the hand of his friend warmly in his own</M>; "Edmund loves his country too devotedly to think of himself when he is engaged in her service."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Well, well, it is all right," <M>cried the duke</M>, "he is a brave boy, that is certain."</DiaM>

Sir Ambrose did not reply, for he had now reached the summit of the mount, and was too eagerly looking round in every direction to attend to his friend's remark.

In those days, the ancient method of conveying the post having been found much too slow for so enlightened a people, an ingenious scheme had been devised, by which the letters were put into balls and discharged by steam-cannon, from place to place; every town and district having a piece of <i>toile metallique</i>, or woven wire, suspended in the air, so as to form a kind of net to arrest the progress of the ball, and being provided with a cannon to send it off again, when the letters belonging to that neighbourhood should have been extracted: whilst, to prevent accident, the mail-post letter-balls were always preceded by one of a similar description, made of thin wood, with a hole in its side, which, collecting the wind as it passed along, made a kind of whizzing noise, to admonish people to keep out of the way.

The mount on which Sir Ambrose now stood, commanded an extensive view, and the scene it presented was beautiful in the extreme. On one side, innumerable grass fields, richly wooded, and only divided from each other by invisible iron fences, appeared like one vast park; whilst, on the other, the waving corn, its full heads beginning to darken in the sun, gave a rich glowing tint to the landscape. But Sir Ambrose thought not of the prospect, he did not even see the murmuring brooks and shady groves, the smiling vales and swelling hills, that constituted its beauty; no, his attention was wholly occupied by a small black spot he had just discovered on the edge of the horizon. In breathless anxiety, his eyes almost starting from their sockets, he bent eagerly forwards, gazing on this small and at first almost imperceptible speck. It gradually grew larger and larger -— it rapidly approached! and in a few seconds a slight noise buzzed through the air as the long-expected balls whizzed past him.

Sir Ambrose's agitation was excessive; with trembling limbs and livid lips, he hurried to the nearest station, which luckily was close at hand, and round which several of his household were assembled, in their impatience to hear the news. Sir Ambrose could not speak, but the person whose province it was to sort the letters guessed his errand, and opening the bag held forth the ardently expected treasure. Gasping for breath, Sir Ambrose eagerly attempted to take it, but his hands were unequal to the task, the violence of his emotion overpowered him, and after a short, but fruitless struggle, he fell senseless on the ground.

The confusion produced by this unexpected incident was indescribable. The old duke walked up and down, wringing his hands, and exclaiming, <DiaQ>"What shall we do? What will become of us?"</DiaQ> whilst the rest of the party endeavoured to give assistance to Sir Ambrose.

<DiaM>"Parental affection," <M>said Davis, who had an unfortunate propensity for making long speeches precisely at the moment when nobody was likely to attend to him</M>; "parental affection has been universally allowed by all writers, both ancient and modern, to be one of the strongest passions of the soul, and the most exalted instances might be produced of the surprising energy of this universal sentiment."</DiaM>

<DiaM>“For Heaven's sake help me to raise my father," <M>cried Edric</M>: “Give him air, or he will die!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Patience," <M>continued Davis</M>, "is necessary in all things, and is perhaps one of the most useful and estimable qualities of life. It enables us to bear, without shrinking, the bitterest evils that can assail us. Without patience, philosophy would never have made those wonderful discoveries that subjugate nature to our yoke."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Fetch me some water," <M>exclaimed Edric</M>, "or he will expire before your eyes."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It appears to me," <M>said a labourer, who had been mending a steam digging-machine in a neighbouring field, and who now stood leaning upon his work, and looking on gravely at all that passed, without attempting to offer the least assistance;</M> -- "It appears to me that it would be highly improper to administer the aqueous fluid in its natural state of frigidity, under the existing circumstances. The present suspension of animation under which Sir Ambrose labours, is evidently occasioned by want of circulation. Now, as it is the property of hot liquors, rather than cold ones, to supply the stimulant necessary for the reproduction of circulation, I opine that hot water would answer the purpose better than cold."</DiaM>

In the mean time Father Morris had brought some water from a neighbouring fountain, and throwing it on the patient's face, Sir Ambrose opened his eyes: for some moments he stared wildly around him, but, as soon as he began to recollect what had passed, he implored Father Morris to give him his ardently desired letter.

<DiaM>"You are not yet equal to reading it," <M>said Father Morris compassionately</M>; "I fear the exertion will be too much for you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh give it me! give it me," <M>exclaimed the poor old man;</M> "if a spark of mercy remain in your soul, do not keep me in this agony!"</DiaM>

It was impossible to resist the tone of real anguish that accompanied these words, and Father Morris put the letter into his hands. -— Sir Ambrose took it eagerly; though he trembled so, that he could scarcely break the seal. At last, he tore it open and gazed at its contents, but he could not read a word; he dashed away his tears, and rubbed his eyes impatiently —- all was in vain -— the writing was still illegible —- <DiaM>"Read! read!" <M>cried he, in a voice trembling with agitation</M>, "For Heaven's sake read! —- will no one have pity on me?"</DiaM>

Father Morris took the letter, and read it aloud, whilst Sir Ambrose sate -— his eyes raised to Heaven, his hands clasped together, and the tears rolling down his aged cheeks, listening to his words, and drinking in every syllable. After giving a circumstantial account of the battle, and assuring his father that he had not been wounded, Edmund proceeded thus. <Dia><QuotedText>"The Queen has written me a letter of approbation in her own hand, and has been graciously pleased to signify her intention of honouring me with a triumphal entry into London; she has likewise conferred upon me letters of nobility. The goodness of my sovereign makes a deep impression upon my breast; but for the rest, I assure you that neither the applauses of the multitude, nor the privilege of writing Lord before my name, can afford a moment's satisfaction to a heart that pants only for the pleasure of seeing again those most dear to it; nor shall I enjoy my triumph unless those I love be present to give it zest."</QuotedText></Dia>

<DiaM>"I congratulate you, my dear sir!" <M>exclaimed Father Morris, as soon as he had finished</M>; "I congratulate you from my inmost soul!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Go to his triumph!" exclaimed the duke, rubbing his hands in ecstacy; "Yes, yes, that we will: won't we, my old friend? God bless him! I'm glad he is not hurt, though. And so you see, in spite of all his glory, he can't be happy without us. How prettily he says that! -- 'Not all the approbation of my sovereign, the praises of the people -— nor' -— nor -— what is it? I don't remember the exact words, but I know the sense was, that he couldn't be happy without us, and, God bless him! I'm sure I'm as happy as be can be, at the thought of seeing him."</DiaM>

Sir Ambrose could not reply, but the tears ran down his aged cheeks like rain, as his heart breathed a silent offering of thanksgiving to the Almighty Being who had thus bestowed victory upon his son; and his lips murmured some inarticulate sounds of transport; whilst Elvira and Rosabella mingled their tears with his, for joy often becomes painful, and seeks for a relief like grief.

<ArrivalDeparture>The party now slowly returned to the mansion of Sir Ambrose</ArrivalDeparture>, so completely occupied in discussing Edmund's letter, as to be totally unaware that Edric had not accompanied them; yet such was the case. The youthful philosopher's heart had swelled almost to bursting, as he had listened to the reading of his brother's letter, and he now rushed into a thick wood, shelving down to a romantic stream, which formed part of the pleasure-grounds of Sir Ambrose.

Almost without knowing where he was going, Edric plunged amongst the trees, and threw himself upon a grassy bank under their shade, upon the border of the rivulet. The gentle murmuring of the water, gave a delightful sense of refreshing coolness, particularly agreeable from the burning heat of the day; and Edric lay, his eyes fixed upon the sparkling waves as they danced in the sunbeams, with both his hands pressed firmly upon his throbbing temples, endeavouring in vain to analyze the new and strange emotions that struggled for mastery in his bosom. By degrees he became more calm; and though his heart still beat with feelings he could not quite explain, he felt soothed by the softly gliding streamlet; and the stormy passions of his breast seemed lulled to tranquility as one hand fell carelessly down by his side, and the other merely supported the head it no longer strained.

It was not envy that occasioned Edric's emotions; but shame and indignation burnt in his bosom when he recollected that he was wasting his days in comparative obscurity, whilst his brother, only a few years older than himself, was ennobling the name bequeathed to him by his ancestors.

<MonologueThought>"And cannot I also become famous?" <M>thought he, his heart swelling with emulation</M>. "Though I abhor the profession of a soldier are not other ways open to me of attaining eminence? Why should I not exert myself? I will remain in indolence no longer. I, too, will prove myself worthy of my forefathers, and show the world that the exalted blood of the Montagues has not degenerated in my veins!" <Descriptor>His eyes sparkled with the thought, and he half raised himself, as though eager to put it into immediate execution. A moment's reflection, however, restored him to himself, and he could not help smiling at his own folly.</Descriptor> "Anyet I call myself a philosopher," <M>thought he</M>: "Alas! alas! how little do we know ourselves, for after all, the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake is the only employment worthy of a man of sense: and the transitory applause of the multitude, it is beneath him to accept. Nature is the goddess I adore; and if it should be granted to me to explore her secrets, I shall be the happiest of mankind. But why should I pass my life in anxious cravings never destined to be realized? The events of to-day have only proved clearly the little value my society is of to my father: he is too much occupied with my brother to even think of me, and were I absent, I should soon be forgotten. Why then should I not travel and satisfy these restless wishes that gnaw at my heart and poison every pleasure? I was not born to rest contented with the dull routine of domestic life, and I detest hypocrisy: I will seek my father; and, explaining my real sentiments, set off for Egypt immediately."</MonologueThought>

Satisfied with this resolution, Edric rose and walked hastily towards his father's mansion, with all that inward vigour which the consciousness of having made up one's mind is certain to bestow; and which, perhaps, is one of the most agreeable sensations that can be experienced by the human mind, as that of suspense or indecision is undoubtedly one of the most unpleasant.

<Blend><ArrivalDeparture>Edric found his father and the duke busily engaged in consulting upon their intended journey</ArrivalDeparture></Blend>, which was an event in both their lives; for as, since the universal adoption of balloons, journeys were performed without either trouble dr expense, the rich had lost all inducement to undertake them, and it was rare for a man of rank to quit his family mansion unless he had some post at court.

<DiaM>"I have a palace in London," <M>said the duke</M>, "which I hope you will make your home; though it has been so long unused that I doubt whether it will be fit for your reception."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Do not distress yourself about making arrangements for my family," <M>replied Sir Ambrose</M>; "there will be only Edric and myself, and we can make shift with any thing."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Indeed I shall not consent to any such arrangement," <M>said Elvira, who now entered the room with Rosabella and Clara Montagu, the orphan niece of the baronet, who had been brought up in his family</M>; "What has Clara done that she is to be excluded from the party?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, Clara is too young to think of such things," <M>returned Sir Ambrose, smiling.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Not she," <M>cried the duke</M>; "I'll engage for it; are you my pretty rosebud?" <M>continued he, drawing the smiling, blushing girl to his knee</M>. "Shouldn't you like to go to London, eh?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, yes," <M>cried Clara, with all the eagerness and innocence of fifteen, for that was her age</M>; "very much indeed, if my uncle has no objection."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"My dear Sir Ambrose," <M>said Elvira, coaxingly</M>, "do pray indulge us."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Well, well, we shall see," <M>replied the good-humoured baronet, smiling</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Thank you, thank you, my dear, dear uncle!" <M>cried Clara, flying to him, and almost smothering him with kisses</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"But I have not consented yet, you know."</Dia>

<Dia>"No, but I'm sure you will, you look so good-natured."</Dia>

<Dia>"Go, go, you are a little coaxing puss: but why did you not come home last night, Clara?"</Dia>

<Dia>“My nurse was so ill, and it rained so: besides, you know, uncle, you gave me leave to stop, if I liked."</Dia>

<Dia>“Well, well, I believe I did. It was of no great consequence; you are always safe under the care of Mrs. Robson: she is a very respectable woman -— hope she's better?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Oh, she'll soon be well now. I'm going to tell her of Edmund's victory; and she said yesterday, if she could but hear that he had conquered, it would cure her, if she were dying."</Dia>

<DiaM>“Off with you, then," <M>said Sir Ambrose, laughing</M>, "you are always on the wing; and harkye, you may tell your nurse also, that you are going to London."</DiaM>

Clara's delight and gratitude were unbounded, and she sprang away like a young fawn to tell her nurse the joyful news, while Elvira's eyes sparkled with pleasure, as she thanked Sir Ambrose warmly for his kindness.

The duke was also highly gratified. <DiaM>"You must bring Abelard and Davis also," <M>said he</M>, "for I'm sure you won't be happy without them."</DiaM>

Sir Ambrose owned he should not; and the duke, being like most people who lead dull, monotonous lives, quite delighted with an event that promised a little change, <ArrivalDeparture>bustled off</ArrivalDeparture>, followed by his fair companions, fully determined to make the most of it.

Edric's heart throbbed violently when he found himself alone with his father; the moment was arrived he had been so ardently wishing for, and yet he was silent. He had scarcely had patience to wait the end of his father's conference with the duke; and whilst it had lasted, he had been arranging and re-arranging a thousand times in his mind, the phrases he meant to make use of; yet now they seemed to have all vanished from his memory, and he stood gazing through the open window, his mind feeling a perfect chaos, and without being able to recollect one single word of what he had determined to say.

After continuing for some time in this state of irresolution, he was suddenly startled by his father's exclaiming, <DiaQ>"Well, Edric, my dear boy, I am very glad I have an opportunity of speaking to you alone, as I have something of importance to communicate."</DiaQ>

The voice of Sir Ambrose sounded harsh and abrupt in the ears of his son, and Edric felt incapable of uttering a single word in reply.

<DiaM>"What is the matter ?" <M>cried Sir Ambrose, after a short pause</M>; "surely you are not ill? Edric, my dear boy, do speak; shall I send for Dr. Coleman?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, no, no!" <M>cried Edric, faintly</M>; "I am not ill, I assure you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>“What is the matter, then?" <M>resumed Sir Ambrose, impatiently</M>; "Perhaps, you want some new philosophical instrument, and you don't like to ask for it, because you know the low state of my finances. But don't distress yourself on that account, for you are going to marry a rich wife, and then you can indulge yourself with any thing you like."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Marry!" <M>cried Edric, in alarm</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>“Yes," <M>returned his father</M>, "the duke has just most generously proposed that you shall marry Rosabella; and that he will give her a fortune equal to what he gives Elvira."</DiaM>

<Dia>"But I do not love Rosabella, and nothing shall induce me to marry her: I should be utterly miserable even to think of it."</Dia>

<DiaM>"Not marry Rosabella!" <M>exclaimed Sir Ambrose, in the utmost astonishment</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"Indeed, I cannot. I am convinced she would make me wretched, for our tempers don't assimilate, and we should both be miserable. I should be very sorry to cause either you or the duke a moment's uneasiness. But in an affair like this, which concerns the happiness of my whole life. -— "</Dia>

<DiaM>"Don't talk to me, Sir," cried Sir Ambrose, in a violent passion, "I won't hear a word, Sir -— not a syllable: <i>my</i> son shall obey <i>my</i> orders. Go to your room, Sir, and prepare to marry Rosabella immediately, or never expect to see my face again."</DiaM>

<DiaM>“My dear father!" <M>said Edric, attempting to take Sir Ambrose's hand</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Away, Sir!" <M>cried the baronet, shaking him off</M>; "obedience far outweighs words. If I <i>am</i> your <i>dear</i> father, you will act in compliance with my wishes; and if you do not, it is a mockery to call me 'dear.'"</DiaM>

<Dia>"I cannot marry Rosabella!"</Dia>

<Dia>"Was ever such obstinacy! -— such folly! The world will think you distracted."</Dia>

<DiaM>"I care not for the world!" <M>cried Edric, impatiently</M>.</DiaM>

<Dia>"But you must care for the world -— the world must not be slighted! and as long as you live in it, you must conform to its opinions. I don't like to hear people say they don't care for the world; when people pretend to scorn it, it is generally because they have done something to make it scorn them."</Dia>

<Dia>"But, my dear father! you would not wish me to sacrifice my conscience to its dictates."</Dia>

<Dia>"And pray, Sir, what has your conscience to do with the matter in question?"</Dia>

<Dia>"Should I not sacrifice it by marrying a woman I feel I could never love? In my opinion, nothing can be more sacred than the marriage vow; and with what feelings could I enter into this solemn engagement in the presence of Almighty God, calling upon him to witness it, when I knew my heart was at variance with my words? My soul would recoil with horror at such blasphemy."</Dia>

<Dia>“You talk about your conscience, Edric, -— but should you not rather say your inclinations? The person of Rosabella does not please your fancy, I suppose; and to gratify a capricious whim, you would destroy the happiness of your father, and ruin your own prospects for ever."</Dia>

<Dia>"It is not of the person of Rosabella that I complain; I allow her to be beautiful as a Venus, and that her talents even exceed her personal charms: but when I see her dark eyes flashing fury, and her lips curved into an expression of pride, hatred, or scorn, I forget her beauty, and think only of the fearful passions of her soul."</Dia>

<Dia>“Your objections are futile, Edric; at any rate, they are of no avail. You must marry her -— I am sorry it is against your inclination, but I will not have my authority disputed: -— however, as I have always been an indulgent father, I do not wish you to decide hastily, and I give you four-and-twenty hours to make up your mind: at the expiration of which time you shall marry Rosabella or quit my house for ever. No reply, young man; I won't hear a word."</Dia>

It was in vain to attempt a reply; and Edric left his father's presence oppressed by <Sententia>that strange, mysterious presentiment of evil, which, like a fearful cloud, dark, gloomy, and impenetrable, sometimes bangs upon our thoughts, foreboding horrors; though so dimly and indistinctly, that, like the gigantic phantoms we sometimes fancy through the mist of twilight, their terrors seemed increased tenfold by the very uncertainty that half shrouds them from our sight.</Sententia></SceneAction> <ThoughtSummary>Mingled with these feelings, was one of wild, unearthly joy. <FIDambig>Driven from his father's house, he would be free to travel -— his doubts might be satisfied -— he might, at last, penetrate into the secrets of the grave; and partake, without restraint, of the so ardently desired fruit of the tree of knowledge. Nothing would then be hidden from him. Nature would be forced to yield up her treasures to his view -— her mysteries would be revealed, and he would become great, omniscient, and god-like.</FIDambig></ThoughtSummary> His mind filled with a chaos of thoughts like these, which he strove in vain to arrange, and which seemed to swell his brain almost to bursting, Edric sought the study of Dr. Entwerfen to inform his worthy tutor of the change a few short hours had wrought in his destiny.
