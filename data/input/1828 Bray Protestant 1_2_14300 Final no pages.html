<ChapMarker>CHAPTER I.</ChapMarker>

NEAR the city of Canterbury, during the reign of Mary the First, Queen of England, there stood a retired village, which <AuthorWe>we</AuthorWe> shall introduce to our <Reader>readers</Reader> by the name of Wellminster. <Description>It was situated in one of those richly wooded valleys so peculiar to the county of Kent, guarded by gently sloping hills, and watered by the river Stour. A church, erected in the early ages of Christianity, and said to have owed its foundation to Ethelbert, king of Kent, displayed the massive structure and the round headed arch, of the Saxon era. This church was dedicated to St. John the Baptist; as a spring of the purest water, that rose near the spot, was held by tradition to have been the font of baptism to many of the first converts who embraced the Gospel in our Island. A few humble tenements, and a handsome stone-built house of the time of Henry the Seventh, that stood within a pretty garden, formed the village. The whole was remarkable for nothing so much as the beauty of its situation; where woods and water, together with the fresh verdure of the fields, combined to form a scene of that happy and cultivated character, so peculiar to our Island.</Description>

Such <i>was</i> Wellminster. But<Sententia> Time, that subdues empires as well as towns, whose touch withers alike the bloom of human beauty, and the pride of human art,</Sententia> -— Time has long since passed over it with a destroying hand, and the church, the village are no more. So complete has been the ruin, that vainly would the traveller now seek to find even the smallest vestige of their former existence.

<Sententia>But though the works of man perish, his spirit is imperishable. And, hallowed by the memory of some great and honoured deed acted by that spirit, even a barren rock often becomes more interesting to posterity, by the association of kindred feelings, than a land glowing with beauty, unmarked, unendeared by moral sympathy.</Sententia>

During the reign of Edward the Sixth, Cranmer had placed in the hamlet of Wellminster a pastor of his own choice, Owen Wilford, -— a man who for some time had served him in the capacity of secretary, but who, devoted to literature, and the quiet pursuits of a retired life, preferred the seclusion of a small country cure, to his office in Lambeth Palace, where he necessarily became engaged in affairs more immediately connected with the court. Owen was a zealous Reformer. He had resided in Germany during that eventful period, when the followers of Luther devoted their lives, and all that they possessed, to the reformation of the Church. He had been the author of some learned tracts in support of his opinions; and it was by these that he at first became known to Cranmer.

Owen Wilford was a married man. He had a son and daughter (now grown up); nor did he enter into holy orders till Edward the Sixth allowed the clergy to have wives. Soon after, as we have stated above, Cranmer placed him at Wellminster. As a pastor, he was eloquent and zealous in the pulpit; and in his life and conversation, honest and sincere; whilst a thousand acts of kindness and benevolence endeared him to his simple flock, who looked to him as to a common father.

His wife, whose character was in many respects similar to his own, was alike beloved by the villagers; so that, what with their instruction and example, there was not perhaps a happier, or a more virtuous village in all England.

Cranmer, who really loved the pastor for the simplicity and excellence of his character, had been desirous to promote him in the Church; but Owen declined this kind intention of his patron. Owen was indeed one of those rare men who love not this world's goods, for their own sake. He was fast declining into the vale of years. Contented with a sufficiency, and endeared to his parishioners, he did not wish for a change, especially as he considered that his children would be well provided for; his son Edward (now grown to man's estate, and travelling in foreign parts,) being the sole heir to his maternal uncle, a person of considerable opulence. For his children, therefore, he wanted nothing; and for himself he had enough, since his necessary wants and comforts were amply supplied; and he would often say, <SententiaCharacter>"that man was rich, who was content with what he had."</SententiaCharacter>

Whilst Cranmer lived unmolested, Wilford was secure by the favour of his excellent patron; but ever since the melancholy fate of that great martyr, he had looked forward, as a certain consequence of his master's fall, to the day of persecution for himself. Cardinal Pole, acquainted with his character, and using towards him that moderation which he wished to be extended to all the Reformers, had suffered him to remain undisturbed in his cure, and contented himself with enjoining Wilford (as he had done all others of the clergy within his diocese) to perform mass in the Latin tongue, instead of the service of the English liturgy adopted in the reign of Edward the Sixth; to see that his parishioners came to confession, that the rood should be set up again in his church, and that holy bread and water should be distributed to the people. And though it was said that the enemies of Wilford whispered in the ear of the Cardinal, that he did not obey these orders, but still read the English liturgy, and preached against Popery as zealously as ever; yet the Cardinal, either from inattention, or an unwillingness to bring forward a man whose character he respected, but whose disobedience, if he did so, he must punish by the laws against heresy, still suffered him to be undisturbed.

The insignificance, too, of the place, of which he was the pastor, had been in some measure his protection; so that, whilst the more known and distinguished clergy and the inhabitants of large towns were dragged to the stake, the little village of Wellminster for a time escaped the violence of the general persecution. Another cause also existed, that had hitherto helped to save Wilford. Sir Richard Southwell, high-sheriff of the county of Kent, a man of power and wealth, lived near the village, at his family mansion of Wellminster Hall; and, though a rigid bigot, had not interfered to injure Wilford; nay, it is not unlikely that he had extended to him his protection, since it was rumoured that the knight was under peculiar obligations to him for some extraordinary acts of service.

But, be it as it may, Sir Richard and Owen now lived as strangers to each other. And, though the good pastor was thankful to Providence that he had hitherto escaped persecution, yet he did not place any reliance on the present silence with which he was passed over, and had long endeavoured to prepare his mind for the worst. Desirous to save his son from the dangers that threatened the Reformers in England, he took the first opportunity to write by a sure hand, bidding him to continue where he was, at Frankfort, till a change in the government, or till better times, might warrant his return in safety. Having finished and dispatched this letter, he prayed God that it might reach its destination and produce the desired end.

Thus in some degree relieved of this care, with a quiet but undeviating constancy, Owen Wilford continued the exercise of his duties, and stood openly and firmly in his pulpit a supporter of the Reformed Faith.

And as, when describing the character of a man, it is natural to say something of his person, <AuthorWe>we</AuthorWe> shall state that Owen was of a tall and dignified figure. The expression of his countenance was intellectual; whilst an air of serenity and benevolence was an assurance of the simplicity and the kindness of his heart. A more venerable person could scarcely be imagined. Attired in his long black gown, his grey hairs falling over an elevated brow, whilst his furrowed cheek glowed with the fervour of religious feelings that animated with unusual lustre his expressive eye, he seemed to realize those ideas that we are apt to form of the primitive fathers of the Church; and, as he raised his hands towards Heaven to bestow upon his congregation the benediction of God, he appeared to be wrapt beyond the things of this world.

<SceneDia><Trigger>One morning</Trigger>, whilst Wilford was preparing to take his usual walk round the village of Wellminster, he was surprised by the sudden entrance of his old and faithful servant, Abel Allen, who appeared greatly disturbed, and, coming up to his master, said in a most agitated manner, <DiaQ>"Thornton is coming!"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"Thornton!" <M>exclaimed Wilford</M>, "Thornton! and to <i>my</i> house?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ay, Thornton is coming, sure enough," <M>replied Abel</M>; "and I don't think he is coming alone either, for I saw him standing in the green lane near Gammer Plaise's cottage, with a couple of fellows of his own kidney, and I do think there was more of them still behind. But who cares for that?" added the old servingman stoutly; "shall I knock him down, or shut the door in his face?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Do neither," <M>replied Wilford;</M> "I will not refuse to see him; although, if I did so refuse, I could find a warrant for it in my own breast. Yet, I will see him. Show him into the little oak parlour, and tell your mistress, Dame Alice, what sort of a visitor we are like to have. I will prepare my mind to meet that man, if I can, with composure."</DiaM>

<ArrivalDeparture>Abel departed</ArrivalDeparture>, to obey the instructions of his master; whilst Wilford, who appeared extremely affected by the very mention of Thornton's name, paced up and down the room with an agitation of manner that was rarely seen in a man of so mild and patient a temper. <Blend>He then descended</Blend> to the oak parlour, where he found his wife (who had been warned by Abel of Thornton's approach) busily engaged in putting several things away in a closet.

<DiaM>"Alice," <M>said Wilford</M>, "you have removed it; bring the book back again, and lay it open, as it was, upon the table."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nay, do not bid me," <M>replied his wife in an imploring tone</M>; "do not bid me; consider what it is."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I do so," <M>answered Wilford</M>, "and therefore I command you to obey me. Shall I fear to have the service to my God in my mother tongue upon my table, because Thornton, the Suffragan Bishop of Dover, is coming to my house? Shall I deny my Master before His enemies, because they are <i>my</i> enemies too? Thank God, sinner as I am, I can meet Thornton with a clear conscience. Bring back the book this moment; and what have you done with Luther <i>De Captivitate Babylonica?</i>"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh do not make me bring <i>that</i> book, I conjure you," <M>said Alice, wringing her hands</M>, "If you do, you are a lost man, though Cardinal Pole himself should plead for you. Be content, I have put the liturgy on the table again; be content with that. Why rush into danger? And oh, my dear Owen, my husband, don't, don't provoke Thornton; for my sake, for our children's, do be patient with him."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Well, I will be patient, I will," <M>replied Owen</M>; -— "he is coming. Surely I heard old Abel opening the house-door."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes," <M>said Alice</M>, "and Thornton is speaking to him."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Good God!" <M>exclaimed Owen</M>, "must I suffer that man in my house?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Hush, hush, for Heaven's sake," <M>said Alice</M>; "he will hear you."</DiaM>

Wilford threw himself into a chair. He looked pale, but endeavoured to assume a composed air; whilst his wife, scarcely knowing what she did, yet desirous to seem to be employed about indifferent matters, busied herself with some little matters of domestic arrangement in the apartment. The door opened, and the Suffragan Bishop of Dover <ArrivalDeparture>entered the room.</ArrivalDeparture>

<ChNameExternal>Thornton was a man about forty years old, above the middle stature, strong and robust in his limbs, and had a countenance, in the features of which, cunning seemed to contend with malice. There was about him that air of coldness, affected humility, and inflexibility of feeling, that makes up the character of a hypocrite. His address and conversation were of a cast that we should <i>now</i> term puritanical; but Thornton was a zealous member of the Church of Rome: and, by some means or other, he had grown rich, and even powerful, in the exercise of his zealous functions.</ChNameExternal>

Wilford kept his seat; but Alice made the curtsey of salutation to the Suffragan Bishop; and he gave her a good morrow, without noticing the coldness of his reception from the master of the house.

<DiaM>"Master Wilford," <M>said Thornton,</M> "some business of importance, of which I shall speak anon, has brought me hither. But how is your son? when had you tidings of him? and how is your pretty daughter, Mistress Rose? <i>Thy</i> children they are in the <i>flesh;</i> though, I grieve to say it, Master Wilford, they cannot be such in the spirit, since the new law, or rather the old law renewed, holds them illegitimate; no wedlock being allowed among the holy ministers of the Church."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"If you are come, Master Thornton," <M>replied Wilford,</M> "to discuss points of the new law with me, I neither seek nor entertain the argument. My children are the offspring of a holy contract, sanctioned by God himself; and I never yet knew that human laws could set aside those that are of divine origin. But this is not the matter -— your business with me, be pleased to state it, or I must bid you good day."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I had hoped for a more kindly reception from you, Owen Wilford," <M>said the Suffragan</M>, "since I came as a friend: but good deeds in this world meet with foul recompense."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"They do, indeed," <M>answered Wilford</M>, "as none can better testify than yourself, Master Thornton, and that by experience; for you once served Archbishop Cranmer, and can tell how <i>he</i> was requited."</DiaM>

Alice looked at her husband imploringly, as if she would say, <SpeechImagined>"Forbear that point; do not provoke him."</SpeechImagined> Thornton was unmoved: he had a conscience hard as the nether millstone, and he did not now choose to understand this glance at his own ingratitude to Cranmer.

<DiaM>"I wait to learn the nature of your business with me," <M>continued Wilford</M>; "and having done so, the sooner we part the better."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"His Grace, Cardinal Pole," <M>replied Thornton</M>, "languishes much, and being in weak health, he can no longer exert himself to take an active part in public affairs."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I am sorry to hear it," <M>replied Owen</M>, "since I cannot choose but admire virtue even in an enemy, and the Cardinal's moderation would adorn a better faith."</DiaM>

The Suffragan showed no displeasure at this remark, but continued: <DiaQ>"I have full powers, Master Wilford, both from the Cardinal, as legate <i>a latere</i> to his Holiness Paul the Fourth, and from our gracious Sovereign, Queen Mary, and her council, to act in the place of the said Cardinal Pole, in the diocese of Canterbury; being joined in commission with certain other appointed authorities. In short, I come to see that those statutes passed in the parliament of the second of the present reign, respecting the affairs of the Church, are duly and properly observed; and, for this purpose I am now peregrinating the diocese of Canterbury."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"By the instigation of my Lord of London," <M>said Wilford</M>. "I perfectly comprehend it. Bonner, grown odious to the people by the cruelties he has exercised in his own diocese, to save himself, if possible, from utter detestation, has relaxed in some measure the persecutions of Smithfield; and now would cloak his malice, by extending them, with double fury, to the sees of other bishops. If I mistake not, Master Thornton, you were specially nominated Suffragan Bishop of Dover, by the recommendation of my Lord of London. Doubtless you have his counsel what to do. Are you to begin with me?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nay," <M>said Thornton</M>, "do not speak thus warmly. Did I repeat such words as you now utter, think what would be the consequence! But I will give you a proof of that moderation you are pleased to commend in his Grace, Cardinal Pole, my very good Lord. I will set down your words to the score of passion; and passionate men and madmen being of one nature, as the late learned medical doctor Butts used to say, I will pass them over unnoticed, and give farther proof of my good-will and friendship towards you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I want neither," <M>replied Wilford</M>. "Once more, tell me the matter of your business with me and, in God's name, depart, if you can, in peace."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I came hither in peace," <M>said the Suffragan</M>, "and so will I depart. I come to propose some questions to you, Owen Wilford, and to offer you some terms, easy to perform —- Allow me to call in my secretary."</DiaM>

The Bishop of Dover, for a minute, quitted the room, and returned, <ChNoNameExternal><ArrivalDeparture>followed by a little, thin man</ArrivalDeparture>, dressed in a black gown, a bundle of papers in one hand, a satchel at his back, an ink-horn depending from his button, and a flat and square black silk cap on the crown of his head. His eyes were small and red like those of a ferret; and his nose, of considerable length, looked like a label for an inscription, upon which might be written the word "impudence."</ChNoNameExternal>

<DiaM>"Sit down, Master Secretary," <M>said the Suffragan,</M> "and write the answers to some questions that I have to propose to this man here present."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Is my own house to be made a court of inquisition?" <M>exclaimed Owen</M>. "I shall answer you no questions till I see the warrant upon which you act."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The warrant is my word," <M>Thornton haughtily</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Not with me," <M>replied the Pastor calmly</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Show this man the warrant, then, Thomas Cluny," <M>said the Suffragan to his Secretary</M>.</DiaM> Cluny shuffled over the papers, took out a fair written parchment, to which was appended a large seal; and coming up to Wilford, he said, <DiaQ>"Be pleased to see the Broad-seal of England. The warrant is from the Council; shall I rehearse the indictment ?"</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"No," <M>answered Wilford</M>; "I see this is a net to catch me. But, thank God, I am prepared. What are your questions?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Have you," <M>said Thornton</M>, "caused the rood, sent here at Candlemas last, to be set up in a fair loft in the Church of St. John the Baptist, in the Parish of Wellminster?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No!" <M>exclaimed Wilford</M>; "the wooden god of your idolatry lies now where it was left by your own people, in the belfry of the church. I will never, like Nebuchadnezzar, set up a golden image, and bid the people to fall down and worship it, at the sound of the lute, harp, cornet, or dulcimer. I deny the worship of <i>your</i> cross, and I will never yield to it."</DiaM>

Thornton shook his head, whilst Cluny's square cap shook in accompaniment to the same. He dipped his pen in the ink-horn. <DiaM>"Write down that he denies the cross," <M>said the Suffragan.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"An offence under the statutes of Richard the Second, Henry the Fourth, and Henry the Fifth," <M>said Cluny.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Write, that I deny your crosses of wood and stone," <M>said Wilford</M>, "and you will find that comes under the statute of God's first commandment -— <QuotedLit>'Thou shalt worship no graven image.'</QuotedLit>"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That is the Levitical law," <M>cried Thornton</M>. "Why, the holy Saint Austin defend us! have we to deal with a Jew here?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Shall I write down that Master Wilford confesses only the Levitical law?" <M>inquired Cluny</M>. "That offence comes equally under the aforesaid statute."</DiaM>

Wilford looked at the secretary a moment with contempt; but, resuming his composure, he said, <DiaQ>"Why should I be angry with thee, poor wretch? thou art nothing more to this man than that pen is to thee, -— his instrument. I will save your pains; write all in one word, -— write that I deny the supremacy of the Pope, the errors of the Church of Rome, and acknowledge only the truth of the Christian faith, as it is revealed to us in the Gospel itself. I will answer no more questions. And now do your work, for I am ready."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"That's clear!" <M>exclaimed Cluny</M>; "that comes under the direct statute for heresy, in the second of the present reign. Denies the Pope! here be heresy indeed, I must make a note of this;" <M>and again Cluny dipped his pen into the little ink-horn</M>. "This ink is as bad and as muddy as if it was manufactured in a scrivener's shop."</DiaM>

Cluny once more prepared to write; but Alice, who had listened, in an agony of feeling, to the bold and open confession made by her husband of his faith, now sprang towards the table, and snatching the pen from Cluny's hand, she exclaimed, <DiaQ>"You shall not, you shall not write it! He is no heretic, but a good Christian! Spare him! oh! spare him!"</DiaQ>

The Suffragan Bishop, who had hitherto stood quite unmoved, now interfered; and bidding Alice be quiet, or that she would make things worse, he desired Cluny to continue his business; whilst Alice wept and wrung her hands alternately, assuring the Bishop that her husband was a true Christian, and imploring Wilford not to provoke the anger of his enemies. Wilford gently removed her from him, and stood silent, with a firm and upright demeanour, as the secretary wrote down the confession he had made of his faith. This accomplished, Thornton whispered something in the ear of his secretary, who departed, and in a few minutes returned, accompanied by a number of persons, headed by the town-constable of Canterbury; this band having purposely been laid, as it were, in ambush near the house, ready to obey the orders of Thornton. Alice saw them pass on the outside of the window, as they came to enter the house; and uttered a loud scream, clinging to her husband, and almost fainting in his arms.

<DiaM>"Take the woman off," <M>said Thornton to Cluny, who had again entered the room</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"You shall not touch her," <M>exclaimed Wilford, in a tone of more passion than he had yet used</M>; "she is my wife, my dear and honoured wife. God gave her to me, and none but God shall part us."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Hear him!" <M>said Thornton</M>, "hear him! he calls his harlot his wife! But this must be no longer endured. The Church has too long dealt mercifully with thee. Such open shame may no longer be endured. -— Cluny, I say, take that woman from the man, and let them both hear the denunciation of the true Church against their offence. I arrest you, Owen Wilford, on your confession, for heresy. I expel you in the name, and by the authority given under the warrant of the Queen and Council. I expel you from this cure as a married priest, as an obstinate and disobedient heretic, and as a traitor to his Holiness the Pope. You, and the harlot you call your wife, are henceforth for ever parted; and she will be made to do a necessary penance for her offence, as the law enjoins."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Under the proclamation against harlots and disorderly persons," <M>said Cluny</M>, "of the second of the present reign, the said penance to be done bare-footed, in a white sheet, with a faggot in one hand, and a taper in the other, in the nearest church or churches of the parish or parishes where the said offence was committed, according to the said proclamation of the said date."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"My wife! my poor Alice!" <M>exclaimed Wilford, bursting into tears</M>, "be of good cheer —- look up, sweetheart, and comfort me in the hour of my sorrow; for I am an old man, well nigh broken down with years, and it may be that I want God's grace to bear this trial. Where is our child, where is poor Rose?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Where are you, Owen," <M>said Alice</M>, "oh! where will you be. -— Good God! will they take you from us, and must I and my poor girl live to see you in a prison! Oh! have these men no hearts? -— Speak to Thornton. He must, he will hear you -— I am sure he will! I will kneel to him to beg mercy for you, so that they may not take you to a prison."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The statute for heresy commands it," <M>said Cluny, again shuffling amongst the papers.</M> "Here is the Act. -— <QuotedText>'That the prisoner or prisoners, on suspicion thereof (that means being suspected of heresy, Dame Alice,) shall be taken <i>in corpore</i> (meaning in the body, Dame Alice,) to the nearest prison or prisons there to be held <i>in loco</i> (that is, in that place. Dame Alice,) till he or they be brought before the appointed authorities of archbishop, bishops, suffragan bishops, archdeacon or deacons, prelates, priests, or proctors; or in default thereof, that he or they be brought before the nearest sitting magistrate, justice of the peace, mayor, port-reeve, constable, bailif, or baillie for the time being.</QuotedText>'"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"A truce with this jargon," <M>said Wilford</M>, "and tell me where I am to go, and what will become of my poor wife, and my innocent daughter, my dear Rose."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Mercy will be shown to them, and indeed to you, unless you are all obstinate," <M>said Thornton:</M> "you must to prison, and the woman too; for the present, your daughter will only be expelled this house."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"At present the women having been only charged with offences under the proclamation against disorderly persons," <M>said Cluny</M>, "the one being a naughty woman, and the other a bastard of the same, they must both be expelled the house."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Is this your mercy," <M>replied Wilford</M>, "to cast upon the wide world an aged and honourable matron? to cast her from the sanctity of an honest home, for no other offence than that of having lived for more than thirty years the wife of a man who, since his marriage with her, has taken holy orders?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ay, and mercy it is," <M>said Thornton,</M> "when compared to what her shame deserves. A priest can have no wife."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Why Cranmer was a married man," <M>answered Wilford</M>, "when you, Thornton, were his secretary, as well as myself, at Lambeth; and you never thought fit to cavil at it then. You were humble and observant in your manner to the prelate's wife, and she did you many an act of service, as well as thy martyred Lord."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Ay," <M>said Thornton</M>, "it is true; but I have long since repented me of that in sackcloth and ashes, repented that I could ever bow me down to Jezebel: yea, better had it been for my soul, had I rose up, and cast her down to the dogs."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Hypocrite!" <M>exclaimed Wilford</M>. "Gracious Heaven! how long will this man be suffered to persecute thy people, and to belie thy word! Look on me, Thornton! Dost thou remember when thou and I were both of us secretaries to Archbishop Cranmer?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I do remember a time of sin and sorrow," <M>answered Thornton</M>, "when I did serve Satan and the man Cranmer, whom you call Arch-bishop; when King Henry the Eighth (St. Peter assoil him) denied the supremacy of the Pope, and set up a king-worship of his own; for the which offence, his Holiness, Paul the Fourth, of Rome, hath been pleased to absolve this repentant realm of England on its return to him, like the prodigal to the father in holy writ. I remember the days of my shame; wherefore, then, shouldst thou speak of Cranmer?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"They were the days of thy shame, indeed!" <M>said Wilford</M>: "for Cranmer, thy gracious master, took thee up when thou wert nothing: he fed thee at his board, cherished thee in his bosom, and was as a father to thee and me; and how didst thou repay him? -— With the basest ingratitude thou didst join with Gardiner to ruin him with King Henry: and when thine own letters were found to convict thee of the foul deed, then how thou didst kneel and beg for pardon! then thou didst stoop to solicit me to plead for thee, and I was thy dear Master Wilford, thy kind Master Wilford, and thy pitying friend; and Cranmer was thy merciful, very good Lord; and thou didst then compare thyself with the prodigal, and him with the father who killed the fatted calf: and Cranmer, ever generous, humane, and noble, Cranmer forgave thee! no punishment followed thy offence; or long since thy name would have been numbered with traitors, who meet the reward of their deserts."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"If I sinned in humbling myself to Cranmer, as you would insinuate," <M>replied Thornton,</M> "it was the sin of necessity; and his Holiness Paul has absolved us of all such sins, and the gates of the blessed St. Peter are once more open to us, since her Highness has consented to pay hi-pence-money. Meet it is that it should be so, since we should render to all, and especially to saints, their due. But remember I quitted the service of Cranmer long before King Henry's death."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Cranmer, I remember, sent thee from his service," <M>said Wilford;</M> "for, though he forgave, he never more trusted thee. And in revenge of this, thou, Thornton, thou wast the man who busied thyself to bring him to his ruin. <i>Who</i> marshalled the Lieutenant of the Tower the way to Cranmer's lodging to arrest him? <i>Who</i> held the torch to light him up the stairs? Thornton, thou didst it! It was thy hand, thy heart, thy act, that helped thy benefactor to his death. I lost patience this day when I heard but thy name; few things could have so moved me."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I shall not trouble myself farther with you," <M>replied the Suffragan coolly; for, unable to answer the charges of ingratitude which Wilford brought to his recollection, he instantly turned to the business before him.</M> "Secretary Cluny," <M>he continued</M>, "proceed to make out the committal of this man to Canterbury Castle; I will put my hand and seal to it, for I will no longer hold parley with such a heretic."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It were to be <i>particeps criminis</i> if you did," <M>answered Cluny</M>, "and against the statute. Hath the prisoner any other name, cognisance, or appellation, besides that of Owen Wilford?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"He has no other," <M>said Thornton</M>, "unless it were the name he, like a false-hearted liar, assumed when he once fled from England, and travelled to Rome itself in disguise."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Shall I put down an <i>Alias</i>, then?" <M>inquired Cluny.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"There is no need of that," <M>said Thornton:</M> "the evidence is clear."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The evidence is most clear and satisfactory," <M>answered Cluny</M>, "being his own confession; and if we wanted more, I am a witness. And here, I think, Master Thornton, we have as pretty a case, as can be, for the writ <i>De heretico comburendo</i>. Be so good, Dame Alice, as to sit down and be quiet, and do not disturb this reverend gentleman, and an officer of the law, in the execution of their duties."</DiaM>

Cluny proceeded to write, as fast as his pen could go, the warrant for committal. Whilst he did so, Thornton demanded of Wilford his keys with much insolence of manner. <DiaM>"Take them," <M>said Wilford</M>; "there needs no violence, since I know I have no choice, but must needs surrender them to you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Master Attorney, Secretary Cluny," <M>said Thornton</M>, "I shall depart anon with the prisoner; and, as he is a man known to be dangerous in his speech, and has led astray many of the servants of his Holiness and of her Majesty, I shall not leave him till we arrive near Canterbury. When I am gone, you will search the house, and bring with you all such books and papers as may be necessary to convict this man of heresy. It will be a great act of justice to bring him to the stake, and to clear the house of the contamination of heretical doctrines. I shall leave Ralph Miller, the catchpole, to assist you in the work. I must now proceed to the church, to give orders about setting up the rood in the loft. You, Cluny, will presently follow me to Canterbury."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The old woman goes to prison," <M>said Cluny</M>; "what is to be done with the young one?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"My child! my Rose!" <M>exclaimed Wilford</M>. "Let her go with us."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"There is no charge against her," <M>said the Suffragan</M>. "She may rest at large, but she and all your people must this night quit the house; Friar John de Villa Garcina is for the present appointed to take charge of your flock, and lead back the stray sheep into his Holiness's fold."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What!" <M>exclaimed Wilford</M>, "Friar John, the Spanish monk who was placed with Cranmer to work upon his mind; and, by flattery, cunning, and the most consummate arts, to induce that great man to commit the only act of weakness he was ever known to fall into; must Friar John have the charge of my village? It was he who wrought upon Cranmer to sign his recantation. For which act my noble master extended his right hand to the burning flame, till it was withered and consumed before his eyes. Must Friar John become the wolf to prey upon my innocent flock?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Friar John, for the present, will hold the cure of this place, till a proper person can be appointed," <M>said Thornton</M>; "the work of faith will thrive when he sets about it."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Rather say, the work of destruction," <M>added Wilford</M>. "But I must submit. I will learn patience. For shall I so long have taken good at the hand of my Father, and shall I not take evil also? I yield, Thornton, for the power is given you over me. Yet, if you have one feeling common to human nature, even to the most savage among men, do not refuse a father's prayer; let me see my child. Let me bless my poor Rose, and I will depart with you to prison without complaint."</DiaM>

Thornton, though it cannot be supposed that he complied with this request from any motive of feeling, did not, however, refuse it; and the father received permission to see his daughter ere he left the house. <Blend>Soon after</Blend>, old Abel Allen, who had learned from the attendants of the Suffragan the duty they had to perform, feeling anxious to see his master before he departed to a prison, <ArrivalDeparture>came into the room</ArrivalDeparture> just at the moment when the good pastor's daughter <ArrivalDeparture>also entered it</ArrivalDeparture>, to bid a melancholy farewell to her parents.

<ChapMarker>CHAPTER II.</ChapMarker>

<ChNameIntro>ROSE WILFORD was about seventeen years old, of a light and small figure, and possessed in her countenance that indescribable expression of simplicity and good-nature, that wins the heart almost at the first glance. Yet, however pleasing Rose might appear to a stranger, it was only her more intimate friends who could duly appreciate her character. With the world, she might be deemed merely a good-natured girl, who, making no pretensions to any thing at all out of the ordinary way, and being modest and simple in her deportment, was not suspected by the generality of persons to possess a mind of a higher and a better order than themselves. Her education had been the care of her fond father, who, knowing the times in which she was likely to live, early prepared her mind to meet them; so that the lessons of fortitude and of prudence he had inculcated, found a practicable example of their utility in the scenes that daily passed almost before her eyes. These lessons, and these scenes of suffering among the Reformers, together with the peril in which Rose long knew her father stood, had given her a serious turn of thought, and considerably checked the natural vivacity of her spirits; so that, whilst yet a girl, she was a woman both in mind and manners.</ChNameIntro>

Rose entered the room with a calmer and more composed countenance than might have been expected; and, whilst her mother stood sobbing and lamenting her husband's fate, in all the bitterness of sorrow, Rose gently whispered her to bear up her heart for her father's sake, and to trust in God for his deliverance. She then turned to Wilford and begged his blessing.

<DiaM>"Thou hast it, my child," <M>said Wilford</M>, "thou hast my daily blessing and my prayers. May the God of all comfort, indeed, bless you! Rose, thy father is going to a prison. But be of good cheer, my girl, and remember there is One who is never deaf to the sorrowful sighing of the prisoners, and that those who suffer for His sake, shall never meet loss. Though their bodies lie in the dust, yet shall they see God, and know Him even as they are known. Thornton,"<M>he added, turning to the Suffragan</M>, "may this poor blossom of comfort that still hangs, though drooping, upon the withered tree of my falling house, -— may she sometimes be suffered to visit me in my prison? If you are a man, do not tear her from me at once -— do not shut her out from these old eyes for ever -— let me look upon her whilst sight is left to me in this world. To do so can neither hurt God nor man."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I do not know that I should be warranted," <M>said Thornton</M>, "in allowing it. But, as far as I can go, I wish to use moderation towards yourself, and all other unhappy persons, whose guilt may bring them under my hands, during the peregrination of my commission. Still, I do not think I should do right in letting any person but the members of our Church, who may convert, have access to a heretic; I think I am not warranted."</DiaM>

<DiaM>Certainly not by the statute," <M>said Cluny</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Still, however," <M>continued Thornton</M>, "it may depend upon the damsel herself; if she is docile and willing to hear reason, and -— in short, I must see what stuff she has in her, and then I may pronounce on this question. Master Secretary, be pleased to make notes of her words. Come hither, maiden," <M>said Thornton, in a milder tone than he had yet used</M>: "of what Church are you?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Of the Catholic," <M>answered Rose</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Humph!" <M>said Thornton</M>; "the Reformers say as much. But I suppose you are a chip of the old block. Are you of the Catholic, Universal, Apostolic, and Roman Church? answer me that!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Good lack," <M>said Rose, who dreaded nothing so much as an answer that might be construed into a motive for keeping her from her father</M>; "how should a poor simple maid like me take upon me to hold debate with you who are of the schools? I am a Christian, I hope; and if the Catholic, Universal, Apostolic and Roman Church believe what I do, they may be Christian people also, though I may not have sense enough to hold an argument on terms. So I trust your wisdom will not take offence, if I say, it is too deep for my simpleness."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What am I to write down?" <M>inquired Cluny of the Suffragan</M>; "for this answer amounts to nothing. Be pleased to tell me, Master Thornton, for I really do not understand her."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nor is there need you should," <M>said Rose</M>, "since the Suffragan of Dover bid you write down my words. To understand them, I take it, is not your office; and the Bishop, I am sure, will not press upon a poor girl questions beyond her years."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"By the rood," <M>observed Cluny</M>, "you are a sly one, pretty Mistress Rose, or I am much mistaken. You would do to shift a point of law as well as Master Sergeant Twistem himself. Had you been a man, a gown and a trencher cap would be all you needed to fit you for a bencher; you seem to have a pretty notion of argument too."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Her answer is knavish and incomprehensible," <M>said Thornton</M>: "one would think she had studied the law."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Alack!" <M>replied Rose</M>, "if it is so, it can have nothing in it like law, I am sure; since law is made to uphold justice and truth, and knavery is opposite to both."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"This is a pretty bird, indeed!" <M>said Cluny</M>; "but we will teach her to sing out a full strain, and then see if she is a bird fit for a cage or not. Put her to the proof; touch her on the Sacraments, Master Thornton."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No, no!" <M>answered Thornton</M>, "she is a young thing, I shall see more of her; I will not take the words of ignorance from her mouth, to catch her by them. I will take care to see her, to instruct her; I will not harm her."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Thank God! I bless you for that," <M>cried Alice</M>: "you will not hurt my child? Thank Heaven, at least you are pitiful to her!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have a feeling of kindness for her indeed," <M>said Thornton</M>, "and it shall do you no harm that I have it; and Master Wilford will doubtless be grateful."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No," <M>said Wilford</M>, "not if your kindness aims at overturning the principles of my child. I would rather that you tore her from my heart at once, than that you should tamper with her mind."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Be silent, father," <M>whispered Rose softly</M>; "do not fear for me. Do not say a word that may hinder our meeting in the prison." And turning to Thornton, she added aloud, "I am told that I am this night to quit my home. May I crave your farther indulgence that I may be allowed to remove some few things necessary for the comfort of my parents? Old Abel Allen will help me to do so; and whoever you please shall see what I take. Much I cannot take, since I know not where I shall this night rest my head."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But I know where you shall find a home, Mistress Rose," <M>said old Abel, who dashed a tear from his cheek with a hand as rough and as hard as a horn</M>; "my master's child shall never want a home whiles I can work, or beg to get her one. My sister Littlewit, an honest widow of Canterbury, has a decent lodging, and thither will I take you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Thank you, Allen," <M>replied Rose</M>, "and I will be no cost to you, since I purpose to labour to help my poor father in prison."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I will see that you shall want nothing, Mistress Rose," <M>said Thornton</M>, "unless you are obstinate. But the time waxes on. Take your leave of your father, for he must depart. Cluny, call in the bills; the man and woman must both to prison."</DiaM>

Wilford embraced his child. <DiaM>"Rose, my beloved Rose," <M>said he</M>, "this is but the beginning of sorrows. Remember the lessons that I have so often taught you, and that now is the time to practise them. Comfort your poor mother; speak to her, child; she has not thy strength of mind to meet evils firmly. Be kind and a comfort to her in her prison, and God shall pour blessings on that young head, for He loves a dutiful child."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"My mother, my poor mother!" <M>said Rose</M>, "what can I do to comfort her? Oh, my mother, trust in God in this hour of tribulation; and though He seems to withdraw Himself from us, as if He were gathered into those clouds and darkness that hang about His dwelling-place, yet darkness to Him is as light. He sees us in our hour of trouble, and He will never forsake us."</DiaM>

<DiaQ>"My child! my child! God bless you! and may He have pity upon your father!"</DiaQ> was all that the afflicted Alice could answer to her daughter's pious address. Wilford looked upon them both for a moment with fixed attention: not a tear was in his eye; he seemed to be struggling with the powerful workings of nature to preserve his composure in those last trying moments; but his lips quivered, and the bystanders could observe a convulsive movement in his throat. The struggle was too much; and nature gained the mastery, as he burst into a flood of tears that coursed down his venerable face, and would have moved to pity any hearts but those that were rendered callous by cruelty and superstition. Wilford broke from the man into whose custody he had been given by Thornton, and fervently clasping his aged partner to his bosom, he exclaimed, <DiaQ>"My wife! my wife! and must we part after thirty years of mutual love? Must man tear asunder what God had joined in one heart, one soul, one interest? Time had left us but a few years longer; and those are cut short by oppression, before death dissolves our bond. I could —- I think I could bear much yet, -— poverty, sickness, imprisonment, -— yea, the stake itself were better than this parting; for I know they will sunder us at the prison. We may never meet again on earth: look up then, sweetheart, and give me one kiss before I go."</DiaQ>

Alice did indeed look up; and, embracing her husband, she repeatedly kissed his forehead, his cheeks, his lips, as if she would concentrate in that moment the warm and holy affection of years of conjugal felicity and love. Thornton, on seeing this, turned aside with affected abhorrence; whilst Cluny drew his trencher-cap more towards the front of his face, and, shaking his head, looked with a reproving air at poor Alice and her husband.

<DiaM>"What!" <M>exclaimed Thornton</M>, "what! act abominations thus in the face of open day! This is a sight enough to make the heavens come down in vengeance upon you both. A priest! a man wearing that gown, as a member of the Church, and thus to play the wanton in the very sight of God's saints!"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Why," <M>said old Abel Allen</M>, "no one saw it but us; and which of us be saints, I trow? May it be your worship or master attorney? And if so, you are the first saints that ever I heard of that would take offence at a man for loving his wife."</DiaM>

Thornton did not deign at present to notice old Abel; but, turning to the catchpole, he said, <DiaQ>"Take away the woman from that man's embrace; take her off, this moment; or I shall think myself a participator in this man's shameless sin, if I suffer the kiss of a heretic in my sight!"</DiaQ> Thornton was obeyed.

Wilford remained silent for a moment; but he looked first upon Alice, and then upon Rose, with an expression the most heart-rending. At length he bent his head, and put both his hands over his eyes, as if he would shut out the sight of what was nearest and dearest to him on earth in the endeavour to calm his feelings. Once more he looked up; he seemed an altered man: the tear was no longer in his eye, although a few moist drops still hung upon his check. His manner was composed, quiet, and unresisting. <DiaM>"Thou, heavenly Father!" <M>he exclaimed</M>, "hast appointed to all men their trial, and their day of grace; oh! teach me submission. Bow this proud heart before Thee. Calm my spirit, and make me patient to take meekly this cup of affliction, and, if it be Thy will, to drain it to the last dregs cheerfully. In all things, I submit myself to Thee. -— Farewell, wife! -— farewell, Rose! May God bless you both. -— Now, Thornton, I am ready."</DiaM>

The Suffragan Bishop led the way, followed by Wilford and Alice, both in custody of his officers. As they passed the door of the house, Abel Allen, heedless of the presence of Thornton, rushed forward and caught Wilford by the gown. <DiaM>"My master, my dear master," <M>said the old serving-man</M>, "what will become of you? and don't go away without saying a good-bye to your poor old servant. I will come to you in the prison, and I'll do any thing for you. I'd go there in your stead if they would let me. -— Do please to stand off," <M>continued Allen, addressing the officers</M>, "and let me say a last word to the master in whose family I have lived ever since I was a hand high. I only want to ask him a thing or two, that can hurt nobody."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Good people," <M>said Wilford</M>, "indulge this honest man's wish. Stand off a moment, and let him speak with me."</DiaM> The request was granted. <DiaM>"Well, Allen," <M>continued Wilford</M>, "your master goes before you. If you are put to the proof, do not shrink from following his steps; for remember for <i>whose</i> sake it is we are thus tried."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I do, I will," <M>answered Abel</M>; "nay, I could find it in my heart to ask to go to prison with you even now, but that I know I may serve you more by being out of one. But what I wanted to say is, that I don't half like Thornton's civility to Mistress Rose, for people do say that he never spares a pretty lass without he has something bad in his head about her. I will work these old hands to the bone," <M>continued Allen, as he held them up</M>, "before she shall ever come to the pass to go to the Bishop of Dover for care. Men say that he likes a fair damsel as well as ever Gardiner did, with all his sanctity."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I have heard as much," <M>said Wilford</M>; "and the thought is like an adder stinging the heart of a father, when he thinks that his child may be in danger from such a man, and that he can no longer protect her."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"But Sir Richard Southwell may and ought to do something" <M>replied Allen</M>; "I'll go to him myself, though I know how you have kept aloof from him ever since what happened before young master went abroad. What will your son, what will Master Edward say, when he hears of this chance?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"He must long have been prepared to hear of it," <M>replied Wilford</M>, "since he knows how the times are in England, and that I could not always hope to escape them. God grant that he has my last letter, and may not return hither! Do you, Abel (for whom else can I trust?) -— do you be a father to your master child, and God will reward you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"A father to my dear young mistress!" <M>cried Allen</M>. "May I never know what a moment's peace is in Heaven or on earth, if I am not father, mother, servant, and brother, and all to her now; and I'll knock down Thornton if he does but look at her."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Be careful what you do, Abel, for her sake as well as mine," <M>said Wilford</M>. "There is one thing I would ask of you. You are allowed to help Rose in securing some necessaries for our comfort; if it is possible, bring my English Bible to the prison; it may be useful in that tongue to some fellow-sufferer, who might not be able to read it in the original."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That I will, if I can," <M>answered Abel</M>; "I'll go back now and see what I can save from the clutches of that long-nosed rascally attorney. There's not a more dirty fellow in all Canterbury; and he was once secretary to Bonner. And who ever served the devil unless it was one of his own imps? Farewell, master; I 'll do my best for you and Mistress Rose, and bring the Bible to you, though Thornton, and Harpsfield, and the Pope himself, should stand in the way to bid me back again."</DiaM> So saying, Allen, sanctioned by long service, and the warm affection that makes men forgetful of the distinctions of place in the hour of affliction, shook his master heartily by the hand, and <ArrivalDeparture>returned back to the house</ArrivalDeparture>.

Thornton now, more fully to indulge his malice, and to show the power that he had over Wilford, ordered him and Alice to be shut into a barn that stood near the church, whilst he proceeded to give orders for putting up the rood, to clear the desks of the liturgy in the English tongue, and all other books belonging to the service adopted in the time, of Edward the Sixth, to make way for masses and missals, and all the other requisites of the Popish worship; and here, for the present, <AuthorWe>we must leave him, whilst we</AuthorWe> return to the good Pastor's house.</SceneDia>

<SceneDia>When old Abel Allen returned back to the little oak parlour, he found Thomas Cluny, the pettifogging attorney, and his understrapper, Ralph Miller, the catchpole, busily engaged in rummaging over the contents of a closet, cabinet, and writing-table. Here lay books thrown indiscriminately together; there, many a fair written discourse, the production of Wilford's own pen, for the benefit of his congregation. And all the little articles of Alice's neat housewifery and poor Rose's industry, were seen lying tossed and tumbled about without mercy, under the hands of these inquisitors. <DiaM>"What have we here?" <M>said Miller, holding up by the corner a book printed in the black letter and bound in vellum.</M></DiaM>

<DiaM>"Alack!" <M>said Rose</M>, "that book is one of my mother's: she used it to help my father in edifying any of his parishioners who might be afflicted in conscience."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Let's see the title of it, Ralph," <M>cried Cluny, and he read aloud</M>, "<i>A Salve for a sore Soul; or, a Plaister taken from the House of Comfort</i>. That's foul, that traitorous. Why that book was written by Doctor Mackerel, alias Captain Cobler."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I don't care who it was written by," <M>said Rose,</M> "there are many good things in that book, and I do not believe that Doctor Mackerel wrote it any more than I did."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And what in the devil's name is this?" <M>cried Miller</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Nay," <M>said Rose</M>, "pray spare that book; give it me ; it is -— it is --"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It is a book of magic, as I live!" <M>exclaimed the catchpole</M>. "I'll not touch it, I'll not put my hand near it, lest the foul fiend should come up in his own person. I'll swear that I saw in it all the damning and damnable characters of magic, the whole cabalistic alphabet at once."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That comes under the statute," <M>said Cluny, taking up the book</M>, "against witches, witchcraft, wizards, sorceresses, jugglers, cunning women, and astrologers. So, so, Mistress Rose! I see we shall have a precious pot uncovered here."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Alas! gentlemen," <M>said Rose, weeping</M>, "how can you call the book by such hard names? It is Greek; it is the Phædon of Plato, written fairly out by the unhappy Lady Jane Dudley's own hand. Cranmer, who dearly prized the book because it was her doing, gave it into my father's keeping, when his troubles first began, before he was sent to the Tower. And when Cranmer was burned, my father kept the book in memory of him, as well as of the Lady Jane."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Yes, yes," <M>cried Cluny</M>, "I knew, from the first, that it was Greek. But I wanted to try you, just to frighten you a little, to see if you would speak the truth. I know Plato very well; he was a great divine, quite a Saint, and much favoured by the Pope. Pray, Mistress Rose, do you read Greek?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"My father gave me the tongues," <M>answered Rose</M>, "as a part of my daily lessons, and I hope that I have profited something by his instruction."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I warrant you have," <M>said Cluny</M>, "and that you would use your tongues, as you call them, to chop doctrines with me. But we must go on with our work, -— Ralph Miller, hand me down that book in the red velvet cover, with the silver clasps."</DiaM>

Rose seemed concerned, and stood anxiously expecting the result of the inspection. Cluny looked at it with an air of self-importance, shook his head, and said, <DiaQ>"That book is enough to do your father's business; that comes directly under the prohibition of the proclamation in the second of the present reign. That's the English Liturgy. -— Ralph Miller, put that into the satchel; that's evidence. -— And what have we here? <i>The Supplication of Beggars by Simon Fish</i>. Pshaw! that's a stinking fish, indeed; it savours of Luther, Calvin, and Knox, all in one mess; it has an odour worse than that of an old tripe-wife's tub. Let the fish go into the satchel, Ralph Miller; and here, let it keep company with the <i>De Captivitate Babylonica</i> of Luther; add to it this infamoud book of <i>The Whore of Babylon Unmasked as her Scarlets at Rome</i>; and then, I think, you will carry with you as pretty a bundle of heresy as ever the devil wove into one knot."</DiaQ>

<DiaM>"They are all evidence," <M>said Miller</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Evidence!" <M>echoed Cluny</M>, "better evidence than a thousand tongues; every page is evidence; any one of them is enough to convict an offender, since her Grace, Queen Mary, has been pleased to make it high treason to have an heretical book in any person's house. And Master Wilford's name I saw in every volume."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Certainly," <M>said Miller</M>, "that is presumptive evidence that they were his books."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It is evidence," <M>cried Cluny</M>, "presumptive, positive, and circumstantial. The Earl of Surrey lost his head for a coat of arms, on the same kind of evidence; the fact of treason, therefore, is assumed."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"We have now pretty well done with the books," <M>said Miller</M>. "Here is one called <i>Quoth He, and Quoth I</i>; is that heresy, Master Attorney?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Heresy!" exclaimed Cluny, "heresy! why I pity thy ignorance, catchpole Miller; it is a gem amongst books, a very pearl cast among swine. <i>Quoth he and Quoth I</i>, is a work of Sir Thomas More's, and a sweet companion it is to his blessed book on the <i>Comfort of Tribulation</i>, and the <i>Supplication of Souls in Purgatory</i>."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And you will not take them too?" <M>said Rose</M>; "surely you do not call them harmful?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Keep the peace, Mistress Rose," <M>cried Cluny</M>; "keep the peace; don't disturb an officer of the law in his duty. And please to hand me over that book that the old man took off the table just now."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I can't spare that book," <M>said Abel very coolly</M>; "I keep that for my own use."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What!" <M>cried Cluny</M>, "contumacious? Do you dare to interfere with justice? Do you know the statute, the penalty for such an act? That all such person or persons, so hindering, letting, obstructing, or offending, the said officer or officers, shall be liable to --"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I know nothing about <i>statues</i>," <M>said old Abel bluntly</M>; "but I know the book is mine, and I won't part from it, and I have it. And you know, Master Attorney, there's an old saying, that possession is nine points of the law; and if you want a tenth, and attempt to take it from me, I'll knock you down, and that will be law with a strong arm, after your own fashion."</DiaM> And Abel shook his fist at the attorney as he spoke.

<DiaM>"Ralph Miller," <M>said Cluny</M>, "you are a witness. This man obstructs an officer at law in the execution of his duty. You are also a witness that he has offered violence and intimidation, both by word and bodily action. This is actionable. I shall order him into custody."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Oh, Abel!" <M>said Rose</M>, "how can you speak so to Master Attorney? Do not let them take you from me. Give up the book; for my sake do it, only for my sake."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Well," <M>replied Abel</M>, "for your sake, my dear young mistress, I will do it. But as for the Attorney, Cluny there, before I would give it up to him, I would --"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Hush, hush!" <M>said Rose</M>, "do not speak your heart; you will but provoke him. Give up the book quietly."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Take it then," <M>cried Abel; and he threw it down upon the table</M>. "It the Bible."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Tindall's translation, as I live!" <M>exclaimed Cluny</M>, "and printed in the time of Henry the Eighth. St. Nicholas bless us! what a work was that, -— what a shameless laying open of sacred mysteries to the eyes of laymen and the vulgar! Holy things should be locked up in an unknown tongue, to keep them from pollution."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Master Attorney," <M>said Abel bluntly</M>, "I know nothing about the right or the wrong of it, in letting us poor men understand God's word in our mother tongue, which we never could do, so long as it was shut up in Latin. But all I do know is, that I have a fancy for that book, for I learnt some good things, and useful things too, out of it; and amongst them I was taught that the world loveth its own. And all people say, the love of the men of the law is money. Now I have saved a little, by long service; and I'll give you a fair angel of King Edward's, if you will let me keep that book, and say nothing about the matter."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What! what!" <M>exclaimed Cluny,</M> "a bribe; offer <i>me</i> a bribe! What do you take me for, pray?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"An Attorney," <M>said Abel</M>; "you might have known <i>that</i>, when I offered to pay for being allowed to keep what was my own."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"And do you dare to suppose that I would take a bribe?" <M>cried Cluny</M>, "and have you the impudence, thus publicly, to offer it? But know, sirrah, that I scorn your insolence, and that I do all things according to law. Ralph Miller, take these keys, and Mistress Rose will conduct you; she is obliged to do it by the statute, in proceeding to search the house above stairs for the books and papers of a heretic. Go up with her and bring down whatever you find -— there now, begone!"</DiaM>

<ArrivalDeparture>Miller obeyed, and Rose followed him</ArrivalDeparture>, to conduct the catchpole into her father's chamber, where he usually studied. Cluny and Abel remained below. <DiaM>"And pray, old man," <M>said Cluny</M>, "what could induce you to presume to offer me a bribe, an angel, to let you keep that book, when the catchpole was in the room? Do you know the consequence of such an offer? Do you know the statute? Do you know the penalty? Do you know what you are liable to? It comes under the statute for attempting to corrupt, suborn, and lead astray by bribes, or bribery, the officer or officers of the King's or Queen's Highnesses, in the discharge of their duties. I am a considerate man myself; but I can't answer for Ralph Miller, -— he may bring an indictment against you for the offence. Something ought to be done to make him hold his tongue. I answer for no man's discretion but my own;"</DiaM> and Cluny took off his trencher cap and put it down upon the table with a slap.

Allen smiled archly, and looked at him and at the cap, from out the corner of his eye; as much as to say, <SpeechImagined>I see what you want.</SpeechImagined>

<DiaM>"Had you asked me quietly and in private," <M>continued Cluny</M>, "just to give you the book; that is, had you asked me not to see it; why, I would have turned my back, as I do now?" <M>-— The attorney turned his back towards the table.</M> -— "And as the Bible is the Bible, if it be in English, Hebrew, or Latin, why, I don't see there's flat heresy in letting a man keep a copy of it, if he asks it of me as a favour. But, fie upon it! not by offering bribes, and to an officer of the law, and before his own catchpole; fie, fie!" -— <M>(Cluny put his hand behind him and shuffled his cap that lay upon the table:)</M> -— "and Ralph Miller, as I said before, may bring an indictment, unless I give the fellow an angel to make him drink a cup of ale and forget the circumstance: and I have a feeling of pity for a faithful servant like you, and I may do something; for I was always reckoned a merciful man, even when I was an under-secretary to the clerk of the Star-Chamber."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"My father was Yorkshire," <M>said old Abel Allen</M>, "though I be a Kentishman; and your Yorkshire folk are cute enough to teach their sons the way of the world; so I understand you, master Attorney. And don't look round just yet; but good luck to you with your trencher cap when you next put it on your head," -— <M>and Abel slipped the angel under the cap as he spoke</M>. "And now, master Attorney, do you speak to Miller, and I'll now beg the book of you in charity; for we are in <i>private</i>."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Put it into your pocket," <M>said Cluny</M>, "and say nothing about it. But I really don't know what you mean about my cap," <M>added Cluny, as he slipped his hand under it, secured the angel, and then clapped the cap upon his head</M>.</DiaM>

The door opened, and <ArrivalDeparture>Ralph Miller entered the room</ArrivalDeparture>, carrying a bundle of papers, and <ArrivalDeparture>followed by Rose</ArrivalDeparture>, who looked extremely alarmed.

<DiaM>"I shall now proceed," <M>said Cluny</M>, "to examine these papers; and, in the mean time, do you, Mistress Rose, and you, Abel Allen, collect together what you wish to remove from the house, and we will search them before we depart. Go about it quickly."</DiaM>

<ArrivalDeparture>Rose again quitted the oak parlour</ArrivalDeparture>, now <ArrivalDeparture>followed by Abel Allen</ArrivalDeparture>. Cluny and the catchpole commenced the examination of the papers. <DiaM>"The Bishop of Dover was most particular in directing me," <M>said Miller</M>, "to give every letter into his hands, because such things may throw some light on the connexions of this heretic, whom, as he was one of Cranmer's gang, the Bishop would make an example of, for the benefit of others."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Assuredly," <M>said Cluny</M>; "the Bishop's orders shall be fulfilled. But what bundle of letters is that you are putting into your pocket? Hand them over to me."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"May I do so and obey the Bishop?" <M>inquired Miller</M>.</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Undoubtedly," <M>answered Cluny</M>; "the law gives full power to the deputy acting in the place of the principal, -— ergo, I, standing here in the place of the aforesaid Bishop, for the time being, possess the authority as the Bishop. I do all things according to law -— so be pleased to hand me the packet."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"There it is," <M>said Miller</M>; "and as I take it, the packet must be of some consequence, for only see the indorsement on these letters: <i>Copy of a Correspondence between Edward Wilford and the unfortunate Sir Thomas Wyatt, beheaded for the late rebellion</i>.'"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"That smells of treason, Miller," <M>said Cluny</M>; "that comes under the statute of the twenty-first of Henry the Eighth; <QuotedLit>'every person or persons holding conversation or communication, either by letters, indictments, signs, signals, or symbols, with any offender or offenders convicted, suspected, or attainted for treason, shall be held <i>particeps criminis</i> in the said offence of the said offender or offenders.'</QuotedLit> This is an unlooked-for discovery."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"It is indeed," <M>replied Miller</M>, "and must go to make a charge, as I take it, against the old heretic's son, Edward Wilford, now in foreign parts. I will be most particular in giving this packet to the Bishop of Dover, since he called me aside, and laid a great stress on securing all letters; so, with your leave, Master Cluny, I'll put the packet once more in my pocket."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Better let me deliver it," <M>replied the attorney</M>; "these papers come under the statute against treason, and not under that for heresy. The Bishop will most likely wish to hand them over to the civil power."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Be that as it may," <M>answered Miller</M>, "I found the letters, not you, master Attorney; so I am answerable fur them. And here they go into my pocket."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"The devil take the fellow's impudence," <M>muttered Cluny</M>. <M>And then he added aloud</M>, "Ralph Miller, it appears to me that you have had much labour and toil in conducting this affair; and I don't see why you should not refresh yourself with a cup of good ale. I'll warrant we shall find it here, for I never yet knew a reformed parson but what had a larder and a buttery fit to regale a lord. These heretics are great friends to creature comforts, and put aside those holy fasts that we of the true Church observe. Call to that old fellow, Abel Allen, and bid him bring us a flagon of his best home-brewed."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What, Abel! Master Abel Allen!" <M>cried Miller aloud, as he opened the door of the room,</M> "we would desire of you to bring down some of your bundles for us to search them, and then to supply us with something to cheer up our hearts to the work. We would crave a flagon of your best ale, and, if you have it, a slice or so of a cold capon, or any thing that may be at hand."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"What!" <M>said Abel, <ArrivalDeparture>as he returned to the oak parlour,</ArrivalDeparture></M> "am I to see my old master's house searched and robbed before my eyes, and am I to feed the thieves that strip him? Help yourselves to what you want, as you have done already in other matters; I am no waiter on St. Nicholas's clerks; nor need I cater for an attorney, since he has a nose and a hand long enough, and ready enough to lead him to other men's goods."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Insolent varlet!" <M>said Cluny,</M> "hold your peace. And don't be a fool, Abel," <M>he added in a lower voice</M>. "Don't you remember what I promised just now to do to make Ralph Miller hold his tongue about your indecency in offering me a bribe? have you forgot? I have tutored him. The Miller will let your sack go untolled; so begone, and bring up the ale; but stay, first put down that bundle you have under your arm, and we will just look at it slightly for form's sake -— only for form's sake, whilst you fetch the ale."</DiaM>

Abel obeyed, and <ArrivalDeparture>went,</ArrivalDeparture> though with evident reluctance, to get the refreshments required of him.

<DiaM>"Miller," <M>continued Cluny</M>, "now the old rascal is off for the ale, lose no time in searching that bundle; so begin with this woman's gear, that I see it contains, and look that nothing escapes you."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Here's a purse," <M>said Miller,</M> "in the bundle, and I see the gold shine through the network."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I seize it," <M>cried Cluny</M>, -— "I seize it, in the name of the Commission. Prisoners and heretics must not be allowed money to bribe, corrupt, suborn, or lead astray the King's or Queen's officers and subjects; it is against the statute. I will put this purse into my own pocket, and render it up to the proper authorities. I now take it by virtue of the law. These gold fish would come into a precious net, indeed, did they rest in the keeping of a heretic as baits to angle with."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Better count over the pieces, however, Master Attorney," <M>said Miller</M>, "that you may know for how much you have to render an account."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"No," <M>answered Cluny</M>, "I'll not so much as touch the strings of the purse; and as to opening it, upon no consideration would I suffer you to do so; the law gives me the power to seize, but none, as I take it, to reckon; and, as the security of these monies is the chief point, lest they be made the instrument of sin and corruption, it were far better that they remained untouched in the hands of the law."</DiaM>

Cluny pocketed the money, and hearing the door open, he looked round.

<DiaM>"Here comes Mistress Rose," <M>said he</M>. -— "Mistress Rose, be pleased to walk aside to that window; my duty obliges me to look to the searching of these goods before they are removed, yet the tenderness of my feelings (a very weak failing, I grant, in a man of my office) makes it painful to me that you should witness what must be a sore sight to your eyes -— I would spare you all unnecessary griefs, -— so be pleased to stand off whilst Miller continues the search."</DiaM> And with these words, Cluny took Rose by the shoulders and fairly shoved her to the window, where he placed her with her back towards himself and his companion. He returned to the catchpole.

<DiaM>"Ralph Miller," <M>continued Cluny in a whisper</M>, "thrust your hands into the pockets of these garments; they may contain letters of consequence that the Suffragan would especially desire you to produce: -— stoop down, and examine that grogram taffeta, for it hath a huge pouch apparently well stuffed."</DiaM>

The catchpole obeyed; and whilst he did so, Cluny, who narrowly eyed him, observed the corner of the packet of those letters he had been so desirous to possess, just peeping out from the pocket of Miller's doublet. Cluny slipped behind the catchpole's back. Rose kept her station at the window, not daring to move on account of the terror in which she held the inquisitors. Miller was busily engaged in hunting the gown of grogram taffeta as Cluny continued saying, <DiaQ>"And you know, Ralph Miller, the consequence of securing all papers as directed by the Bishop of Dover, and more especially such as may have a reference to treasonable practices. It were better for you, Ralph Miller, did you lose your ears than one such document, either by fraud, carelessness, or inattention, since such a loss might be to the profit of others, but certainly at your own peril."</DiaQ> And whilst he was thus speaking, the cunning Cluny, having watched his opportunity, softly and gently drew the packet of letters out of Ralph Miller's pocket, and very quickly slipped them into his own, and never once moved from his station till the more simple and unsuspecting catchpole had finished his search.

By this time <ArrivalDeparture>Abel had returned</ArrivalDeparture>, bearing reluctantly a large flagon of strong ale for the refreshment of the inquisitors. Cluny knew well the weak point in Miller's character, and he now plied the catchpole with cup after cup, as fast as he could swallow them. It was the attorney's object so to muddle Ralph's brains, which at no time were of the clearest order, that he might hereafter be induced to believe he had lost the packet of letters either in the house, or when he had quitted it; the possession of those particular letters, from some cause, being necessary to Cluny himself. Cluny, it is true, sat down at the table with Miller, and affected to take a share of the ale; but he was careful only to taste the cup, and to leave nearly all the contents of the potent flagon for Ralph, who, unable to resist temptation, forgot his business past, present, and future; and, fearing the return of the Suffragan before he should get to the bottom of his draught, made such good haste to answer Cluny's pledge, to the health of the Queen and the success of the Commission, that he was more than bewildered in his ideas, when <ArrivalDeparture>the return of Thornton once more to the oak parlour</ArrivalDeparture>suddenly put an end to this hasty carouse.

Thornton looked severely at Miller; and asked Cluny what was the meaning of this indulgence in his assistant, at a time when he ought to be engaged in the discharge of his duty. <DiaM>"Ralph Miller," <M>replied Cluny,</M> "is one of those persons who lack a draught to help them through their work. But <M>(he added in a lower voice, as he looked significantly at the Suffragan)</M> the fellow is staunch, very useful in his way; though, I grieve to say it, he never knows when he has enough; lacks discretion, Master Thornton, -— lacks discretion. But we must bear with him, since he is no flincher in these necessary matters. You had better, perhaps, all things considered, send him forward with the rest of the officers. What has your reverence done with the old heretic and the woman?"</DiaM>

<DiaM>"Shut them up in their own barn," <M>replied Thornton</M>, "whilst I went to see matters duly arranged for Friar John in the church. Here, Miller, do you go forward to the barn; take up your satchel; it seems well loaded. The prisoners must forthwith be conducted to Canterbury Castle."</DiaM> Miller took up the satchel, heavily laden with the spoils of Wilford's small library, and, making sundry lateral movements, <ArrivalDeparture>managed to stagger out of the house</ArrivalDeparture>, nearly knocking down Abel, whom he chanced to meet in his way to the door. <ArrivalDeparture>Cluny also quitted the house</ArrivalDeparture>.

Rose, who was in the oak parlour when she heard that Thornton was actually proceeding to remove her parents from the place where they had lived happily together for so many years of peace and love, wept bitterly, and begged the Suffragan to let her go to the barn, once more to bid them farewell. But Thornton denied this request, and bade her employ the short time she had to remain in the house in collecting what things she might wish to remove for her own use. <DiaM>"And for your father, Mistress Rose, he is a man," <M>said the Suffragan,</M> "that I much desire to see his own friend, and that he may return again like a stray sheep to the true flock, and spare us of the Commission the pain of inflicting a wholesome and necessary chastisement. Mistress Alice will, I dare say, get clear, upon doing penance; -— and for yourself, Mistress Rose, I have an especial kindness for you, and much pity for your youth. If you are wise, no harm shall come to you; and I will myself take upon me the task of instructing your ignorance."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I will not cumber you," <M>replied Rose</M>, "to make you, Master Thornton, the schoolmaster of so simple a maid as I am; and I hope that I shall not easily forget what I have already learned from my father. I would ask nothing of you but to be merciful to my parents."</DiaM>

<DiaM>"I will not hear any dangerous opinions from your lips, my pretty blossom!" <M>said Thornton</M>; "and as for your parents, you may do much for them with me. And I, considering you as a sister in much danger of straying into the path of perdition, I will take upon me the charge of your spiritual welfare. So, be of good cheer, lass," <M>continued the Suffragan, kindly taking her by the hand</M>; "and do not mar those pretty looks with sorrow;"</DiaM> and he bent his head as he spoke, and somehow or other the Suffragan stooped so low that his face came in contact with Rose's blushing lips before she was aware of it, and Thornton gave those lips a hearty kiss; plainly showing, that however obnoxious the kiss of a heretic might appear to him in others, he had no objection at all to it himself, when the heretic was seen in the shape of a pretty girl. Rose blushed deeply, and started from the Bishop of Dover, hastily exclaiming, <DiaQ>"Do you dare"</DiaQ> -—

Thornton interrupted her: <Dia>"Only the kiss of peace, my child; nothing but the kiss of peace, enjoined to the members of the true Church, when they would greet each other in sisterly or in brotherly love. And I now give it you with my benison, in the hope that it may drive out the Evil Spirit, so that you may come back to the fold of his Holiness's flock -— And so, at present, farewell! and I will not lose sight of you in the desire to do you good, my pretty Rose in the midst of thorns."</Dia>

The Suffragan patted the damsel on the cheek as he spoke, and, quitting the room, set forward to conduct his prisoners towards Canterbury.</SceneDia>
