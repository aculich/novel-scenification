<dia>"But what could I, or even <i>Frederick</i> do, should Frolick run away with you ? He is but a foolish Frolick, and if we were to pursue him, would only scamper away the faster; and if you should fall off, and break your little neck, what would become of poor mamma ?”</dia>
<dia>"O my pretty mamma! — well, now I will be very good indeed, if you will but put the bridle right once more.”</dia>

Frederick was <fidquotes>"sure <i>he</i> could do that;"</fidquotes> —but before he had time to take hold of it, Frolick, with a sudden nod, had twitched it out of her hand. It fell, and entangled his foot, which both incommoded and alarmed him, and he began to wheel about, still treading on the bridle, and appearing to be every moment ready to fall, with his trembling little rider, to the ground; but Frederick, who in an instant had dismounted, seized his foot, and while Mr. Melcombe took charge of Helena, disentangled the bridle, and set poney on his legs again; — but, colouring with terror at what might have happened, cried out —

<diaq>"Helena, Helena, why did you let it go ?”</diaq> — She mounted again with great composure, saying,

<diaq>"So! now you are going to scold!”</diaq> At last, all was adjusted, and they rode peaceably on to Mrs. Villiers’s house, where she was anxiously watching for them at the parlour window. Mr. Melcombe took Helena from her steed with the greatest care, gave her an affectionate kiss, and away she ran to her mamma.</sceneaction>

<scenedia>On the following morning, Mrs. Villiers, having spent some hours in the instruction of Helena, dismissed her to her amusements in the garden: and Helena, <trigger>perceiving</trigger> an <chnonameintro>old man</chnonameintro> who was frequently employed to work in it, and with whom she had formed the <i>strictest friendship</i>, was presently at his side. She would often stand near him, watching him at his occupation, and asking him a hundred pretty questions, which he was ever ready to answer, and sometimes would she busily employ herself, under his directions, and delight in fancying that she was of prodigious use to him in his labours. She had been thus engaged for about an hour, while Mrs. Villiers had been sitting at her work. Helena entered —

<diaq>"Pray, mamma, what sort of a place is London ?”</diaq>
<dia>"A large question, Helena: perhaps you may see one day or other; but what put London in your head just now ?”</dia>
<dia>"Why, mamma, old Bernard says it’s the D—l’s Country — naughty word you know! — he says he saw him there, and told me a great deal about it; it’s a very pretty story, mamma; do, let him tell it you himself.”</dia>
<dia>"Old Bernard talks nonsense; — but my dear child, how you have heated yourself! what have you been about ?”</dia>
<dia>"Hard at work, mamma, helping old Bernard.”</dia>
<dia>"Well, now, go and take off your bonnet, and then come and help me; — for I am tired of this hearth-rug, and want it finished.”</dia>

Away she flew, but <italicsother><i>flew</i></italicsother> not back. Mrs. Villiers began to wonder what was become of her. At last she appeared.

<dia>"What have you been doing all this time, Helena ?”</dia>
<dia>"Curling my hair nice, mamma. Old Bernard said it was very pretty; so, I was looking at it in the glass, and I quite forgot you were waiting for me.”</dia>
<dia>"What should old Bernard know about hair, child ? do sit down, and shade that flower as I have done this.”</dia>
<dia>"Yes, mamma.”</dia>

At that moment entered Frederick, with his arm full of new books.

<dia>"O mamma, look at Frederick!”</dia> — He approached, and, with whimsical gravity, dropped on one knee to Helena, and, tottering, presented the books,

<diaq>"With Mr. Melcombe’s duty to Miss Villiers.”</diaq>
<diam>"How kind is Mr. Melcombe!” <m>said Mrs. Villiers.</m></diam>

<sceneaction>In a few days, Sir Harry rode out.

She was shewn into a room, and Bruce, hearing of it, had the curiosity to pass through, in order to take a view of her. Her form was noble, heightened by all the charms of natural beauty, but in her countenance appeared a ferocious and ghastly gloom, which inspired the beholder with horror and dismay. She had with her a beautiful child, who seemed about nine years old, whom, when Bruce entered, she was pressing to her bosom with convulsions of anguish, while the tears streamed incessantly from her eyes. The boy shewed a lively sense of his mother's sorrow; his heart swelled with tumultuous agony, and he kissed the tears from her eyes without being able to speak comfort to her. She rose at Bruce's entrance, and, with much confusion, endeavoured to recover herself. He advanced very respecfully, and addressed her with a tenderness which was one of the predominant features of his character: <dia>"I find myself reprehensible, Madam, in thus intruding upon your sorrows ; had I known there was a stranger in distress, nothing would have prevailed upon me to interrupt you but the certainty that I could mitigate your affliction."</dia> The lady during some time struggled for utterance; she at last overcame the conflict of fierceness and misery: <dia>"I thank you, Sir, for the benevolent expressions to which I have no claim from a stranger; my wish to see Sir Harry Hyndley has, perhaps, made <i>me</i> an intruder.

While he spoke, he fortunately recollected he was now alone; and pronouncing a very devout address to the gracions Goddess of Liberty, he resolved to abandon himself to the felicity she for the present benignly granted him.

<rhetoricalq><reader>Reader</reader>, have you ever visited this charming country?</rhetoricalq> It is the birth place of <authori>my ancestors</authori> — this can only impress myself; <exclamation>but it is also the scene of a romance striking, eloquent, and seductive! Sir William had also found it dangerous!</exclamation> 'Twas true, his understanding was awake to the necessity of certain restrictions in moral society, and deemed the man a profligate who argued for their subversion: but to read a mere recital was neither to argue, to practise, or to justify its moral defects; and he read it repeatedly, and with new pleasure

<monologue>"It must be owned," <m>said he</m>, "there is something of St. Prieux in my composition. Those vivid sensations, those glowing delights, those unsubjugated fancies, are all features of myself. If I found an Eloisa who could bewitch my senses, I should make no scruple to abandon myself to her control. This would be to prosecute my rambles in the happiest state of perfection!"</monologue>

Musingly he walked forward. His imagination took the reins and drove him at headlong speed. He almost fancied himself in search of the object with whom, to realize the picture. His steps wandered by the lake, whose ripling waters, curling in the moon's beams, soothed his senses to tranquillity. A distant clock at length sounded on his ear, and he returned to seek the path from which he now discovered he had strayed.

To recover it was not however so easy. He missed his way through the windings of the rocks, and finding himself more deeply involved in the labyrinth of an unbeaten track, he endeavoured to descry a human habitation from which he could enquire his way. Even this was difficult; till happening to range round the foot of a barren hill, he accidentally discovered a dim light. On approaching he found it proceeded from a solitary hovel, and hastening towards it, he smartly knocked at the door.

<diam>"Fanchon," <m>said a voice of impatience within, and immediately the door was opened</m> —- "Fanchon, why did you stay so long?"</diam>

Sir William was struck with the tone and form of the speaker, and stood in silent surprise: but...

Silently, she surveyed the lofty dome; heard unaccustomed sounds; and saw faces, strange ones, that she could not yet greet with fraternal love.

In an unknown land, she considered that the Being she adored inhabited eternity, was ever present in unnumbered worlds. When she had not any one she loved near her, she was particularly sensible of the presence of her Almighty Friend.

The arrival of the carriage put a stop to her speculations; it was to conduct them to an hotel, fitted up for the reception of invalids. Unfortunately, before they could reach it there was a violent shower of rain; and as the wind was very high, it beat against the leather curtains, which they drew along the front of the vehicle, to shelter themselves from it; but it availed not, some of the rain forced its way, and Ann felt the effects of it, for she caught cold, spite of Mary's precautions.</sceneaction>

<dia>"Certainly! It is not his intemperance that I admire; no, Sir Harry, it is his valour and fortitude; it is resolution exhibited upon many occasions, that shews him to be possessed of a genuine courage which marks the truly brave: my poor praises, however, would be faint, if you could once see him in his proper sphere, if you could view him glowing with natural ardour, and with unshaken firmness; for instance now, if you saw him take physic! Ah! Sir Harry, the prowess with which he swallowed two pilis and a saline draught! Never shall I forget, when struggling with a cold, which he got by shaving in a hard frost, how he spurned, with a generous indignation, the remedies of abstinence, which his great soul could not brook ! No, Sir, with that undaunted spirit which he may so justly boast, he encountered a sudorific potion of white wine whey; he then went to sleep, submitting for four hours and an half to the ignominious bondage of the bed-chamber: his fever abated; but his mind, Sir, was neither elevated by success, nor sunk by imprisonment; no longer, then, let us say with a malignant and narrow prejudice, that

Even his mind, Sir, is always moving in an intellectual minuet; all the world know it; his fame might entitle him to a dancing diploma for opening every ball he goes to; and I doubt not but his minutest <i>pas</i> will reach posterity: then his temper is as flexible as his toes; he bows benevolently; there is a kind of probity in his mode of being true to the time whenever he exhibits: he keeps time so much better than--" "He keeps his word - which he will, I believe, break to his dearest friend, upon the most solemn occasion."</dia>

<sceneaction>In the month of August, a messenger arrived at Barnhurst Castle, with a letter which he desired might be instantly delivered to his grace the <chnamenointro>duke of Clevedon</chnamenointro>, as it contained matters of importance to him. It was accordingly conveyed to his grace, who was as dinner with a large party and his two sons tire the marquis of Huntley and lord Charles Sidney. 

On perusing the letter, the duke turned pale, and his countenance expressed an emotion of the deepest concern. He had no sooner made an end of it, than he apologized to the company for leaving them, but that a dying friend, requested his presence at the distance of thirty miles. He then ordered his carriage to be got ready in a moment, and, having desired lord Huntley to supply his place, went up to the dutchess while his orders were obeyed. Illness confined her grace to her dressing room; and, after a short conference, he threw himself into his chaise, bidding the servant take the road to <cryptonym>D----</cryptonym>, where he arrived late in the evening, and stopped at the door of a small but elegant house in that village. No sooner was his arrival announced, than an old female servant attended. <diam>"Is your mistress alive?" <m>said the duke in a mournful accent</m>.</diam> <diam>"She is, my lord," <m>replied she,</m> "and yet lingers to behold your grace."</diam> <diam>"Thank Heaven!" <m>answered he</m>; "conduct me to her, that I may receive her last injunctions, and view her once again ere life has forsaken her."</diam> As he spoke he ascended to the apartment of his expiring friend: he found her, with an anxious impatience for his approach, stretched on the bed of death. <diam>"You are come, my lord," <m>said she, in a voice rendered feeble by weakness</m>, "you are come just in time to make the last moments of a fond mother calm and peaceful."</diam> He drew near the bed, but words were denied him, for a short period grief seemed to check his utterance: he took the hand which she had extended to welcome him, and pressed it to his heart: <diam>"and is it thus only we are to meet!" <m>cried he in a voice of sorrow</m>, "am I to behold you but a moment, and no more!"</diam> <diam>"Alas! my lord," <m>replied she</m>, "the awful scene is closing, and shortly I shall be no more; but, for my child, my beloved Helena, I crave your kind protection:"</diam> then, turning to a female form who sat weeping by her side, she said, <diaq>"Approach, my child, and let me present you to your only protector."</diaq> The young Helena was overcome with emotion; and the duke in...

<sceneaction>Theodore and Ludovico were returning from a ramble, and had almost readied the villa, <trigger>when</trigger> their attention was arrested by a vicious horse, which suddenly plunging from one side of the road to the other, not only threatened destruction to its rider, but to every neighbouring passenger. The animal, as if conscious of, and glorying in, the terror he inspired, foamed with fury, reared high in the air, and redoubled every effort to disengage himself from the constraint of the curb. This he at length effected, and the traveller was thrown at the feet of our young friends. Theodore instantly stooped to assist him, while the fiery Ludovico sprung forward at the same moment, seized the bridle of the prancing beast, and vaulted upon his back.

Amazement struck the numerous spectators, who were now assembled on the spot; and this amazement increased as they beheld the skill and resolution with which he combated the efforts of the furious animal; at one time holding him in tight subjection, at another suffering him to waste his strength by unavailing plunges.

<diam>"Strange!" <m>said the original rider, as he stood by the side of Theodore, and coolly eyed his intrepid friend</m>.</diam>
<diam>"You are not much hurt, I hope," <m>observed Theodore</m>.</diam>
<diam>"No," <m>answered he</m>.</diam>
<diam>"I don't like your horse at all," <m>rejoined Theodore</m>.</diam>
<diam>"I do," <m>replied the stranger</m>.</diam>
<diam>"What! after trying by all the means in his power to kick your brains out?" <m>exclaimed the youth</m>.</diam>
<diam>"Yes," <m>said the traveller</m>.</diam>

Ludovico now rode up to them, and alighted.

<diam>"There's your nag, my honest fellow," <m>exclaimed he, delivering the bridle</m>: "he's rather more quietly disposed than when I took him in hand."</diam>
<diam>"True," <m>replied the man</m>.</diam>
<diam>"What's your opinion of my manage?" <m>demanded Ludovico</m>.</diam>
<diam>"Good," <m>answered Michael, for Michael it was who came with the promised summons, and who, being more merciful to his horse than Alberto formerly was, when hastening to the border of Bohemia, had on the road thought oftener about the food than the speed of his beast; and had several times nearly fallen a victim to his mistaken kindness</m>.</diam>
<diam>"Follow us, friend," <m>said Ludovico</m>, "the crowd will only be troublesome to you."</diam>

<scenedia><trigger>One evening</trigger> Salviati was enjoying the breeze in his garden at Pisa —- his daughter Amelia was harmlessly plucking a rose-bud here and there, while Theodore and Ludovico were engaged by more manly employment. A servant appeared, and delivered to Salviati what was at all times one of his highest gratifications —- a letter from Alberto. It treated of the subject just alluded to; but let it speak for itself.

<quotedtext>My dear friend,
I no longer need assure you with what sincere pleasure I read every line which is traced by your pen. This day, after a portion of fatigue, which would play the devil with some of our less hardened countrymen, I found at the guard-house your welcome letter. Yes, my good Salviati, you are right as to Theodore —- he is now sixteen years of age, and it is time that he learnt to wield a sabre. What a delight it affords to me, that his propensities so exactly accord with my wishes as to his future life! It cannot be long before I have an opportunity of procuring for him a desirable post —- expect, therefore, a sudden signal. I would not for the world that he should leave your roof, and lose your invaluable counsel, till summoned to a camp, and to a father's fond embrace. I know what will be your feelings, and you, who were so Well acquainted with the eager impatience, which you used to laugh at in former days, may guess at mine —- expect, therefore, a sudden signal. Would that your mercantile concerns might allow you to be the companion ef my Theodore! Can you not contrive it? I have some stronger reasons for the wish than I now can mention; they particularly relate to the future destination of your own son, towards whose welfare, if in my power, I should be the most ungrateful of mortals if I did not endeavour to provide. Salviati, observe my words. I form this opinion partly from you own letters.
Immense as are the riches you have acquired by commerce, and enviable as is your pre-eminence among that respectable body of the community, which have been at once the chief props and ornaments of Florence, I mean its merchants -— he is not destined to be one. Theodore's letters also convince me that such is the case; for his companion Ludovico's frolics are a constant topic of them. But no more of this at present. We must give the matter a fair discussion over a bottle of hock in my tent —- were it possible, I would say in your house. We take the field at day-break to-morrow. God bless you! Shake hands withthe young warrior for me. I send you inclosed a draft for a thousand rixdollars.
Your's till death, 
ALBERTO DE C**.

This day, after a portion of fatigue, which would play the devil with some of our less hardened countrymen, I found at the guard-house your welcome letter. Yes, my good Salviati, you are right as to Theodore —- he is now sixteen years of age, and it is time that he learnt to wield a sabre. What a delight it affords to me, that his propensities so exactly accord with my wishes as to his future life! It cannot be long before I have an opportunity of procuring for him a desirable post —- expect, therefore, a sudden signal. I would not for the world that he should leave your roof, and lose your invaluable counsel, till summoned to a camp, and to a father's fond embrace. I know what will be your feelings, and you, who were so Well acquainted with the eager impatience, which you used to laugh at in former days, may guess at mine —- expect, therefore, a sudden signal. Would that your mercantile concerns might allow you to be the companion ef my Theodore! Can you not contrive it? I have some stronger reasons for the wish than I now can mention; they particularly relate to the future destination of your own son, towards whose welfare, if in my power, I should be the most ungrateful of mortals if I did not endeavour to provide. Salviati, observe my words. I form this opinion partly from you own letters.
Immense as are the riches you have acquired by commerce, and enviable as is your pre-eminence among that respectable body of the community, which have been at once the chief props and ornaments of Florence, I mean its merchants -— he is not destined to be one. Theodore's letters also convince me that such is the case; for his companion Ludovico's frolics are a constant topic of them. But no more of this at present. We must give the matter a fair discussion over a bottle of hock in my tent —- were it possible, I would say in your house. We take the field at day-break to-morrow. God bless you! Shake hands withthe young warrior for me. I send you inclosed a draft for a thousand rixdollars.
Your's till death, 
ALBERTO DE C**.
Colonel of the Fifth Austrian Hussars.</quotedtext>

<sceneaction>He soon was informed by her of the leave she had obtained; and as the weather was rather unsettled, innocently asked if he thought they could not stay an hour or two at the fruit shop, in case it should be so wet as to prevent their walking.

Stanly reserved his reply 'till he met her, when he told her that his regard for her was so great, that for fear the woman of the shop should think it singular, he had promised to pass the evening at the house of a friend, who, was lately married to a near relation, and who, knowing his intentions of being united to her as soon as circumstances should permit, would be happy to be introduced to her.

Such was Stanly's answer; <trigger>and coming to a stand,</trigger> he helped Emily into a coach, and, in a low voice, told the man where to drive: he was, however, overheard by the waterman, who, as the coach rolled off, winked at one of the coachmen who was sitting on his box, at the same time saying in a voice loud enough to be heard by Stanly,

<diaq>“I say, Jack, there they go. She looks like a new hand. I ha'nt seen her face before."</diaq>
<diam>“Why: where be they going?" <m>said the coachman</m>.</diam>
<diam>"Oh, to Tom <cryptonym>-----'s</cryptonym>," <m>returned the waterman; repeating the whole of the High Priest's name.</m></diam>

Stanly hastily drew up the glasses, lest Emily should hear more than he wished: but though indeed she heard what the man said, as she was not able to attach any meaning to it, she let it pass unnoticed.

The coach driving through a square and down a narrow street, stopped at a large door, before which was a porch. The coach-door was immediately opened by a man-servant, who, letting down the steps, Stanly enquired if Colonel Robarts was within: and the servant having replied in the affirmative, he helped Emily to alight, and, preceded by the man, entered a large handsome drawing room, at the upper end of which, on a sofa, sat a gentleman and a lady, whom Stanly introduced to Emily as Colonel and Mrs. Robarts; but who were in fact no other than Tom, the High Priest; and one of his Priestesses, hired for the occasion.

The conversation was of a general nature; and Emily could not avoid observing, that the Lady expressed herself sometimes in rather a coarse, vulgar manner: Colonel Robarts, however, conducted himself in the easy, familiar style, of a man of fashion: for <reader>the reader</reader> must be informed that Tom received his education at a large seminary at the West End of the town; and if the company of the female part of the creation, can tend to polish the manners of mankind, Tom had certainly, throughout his l...

<scenedia>Miss Fordyce was under some anxiety respecting her friend's return, as it had struck twelve; and she could in no way account for her staying to so late an hour with Stanly, romantic as she was, though she knew it was the custom for, lovers to walk together by moonlight, <quotesother>"when the song of the birds is no longer heard in the groves, and nature seems hushed to repose, save the Nightingale who tunes her love-labored ditty."</quotesother> Though she knew that then was the time for lovers to whisper their soft tales, yet that night was far from answering the above description.

<trigger>At length</trigger> a coach stopped, and in glided Emily to the parlour where Miss Fordyce was sitting: but ah! how changed from what she was when she last saw her!

Miss Fordyce was now all anxiety to hear the adventures which, she had ho doubt, was similar to some she had read in romances, but was greatly disappointed to find that the parties concerned were only a drunken Lord and a Commoner equally so; who, as Emily said, <fidquotes>"would not let them pass quietly through the streets."</fidquotes>

<scenedia><trigger>One morning</trigger>, whilst Wilford was preparing to take his usual walk round the village of Wellminster, he was surprised by the sudden entrance of his old and faithful servant, Abel Allen, who appeared greatly disturbed, and, coming up to his master, said in a most agitated manner, <diaq>"Thornton is coming!"</diaq>
<diam>"Thornton!" <m>exclaimed Wilford</m>, "Thornton! and to <i>my</i> house?"</diam>
<diam>"Ay, Thornton is coming, sure enough," <m>replied Abel</m>; "and I don't think he is coming alone either, for I saw him standing in the green lane near Gammer Plaise's cottage, with a couple of fellows of his own kidney, and I do think there was more of them still behind.

<diam>"Do neither," <m>replied Wilford;</m> "I will not refuse to see him; although, if I did so refuse, I could find a warrant for it in my own breast. Yet, I will see him.

<dia>"So shall I you, Helena, and I don’t like going at all: but go I must, and let us not think about it.”</dia>
<dia>"Aye, but you won't want me half so much at Eton, as I shall want you here.”</dia>
<dia>"You at Eton! — a dove in a rookery — a fly in a bee-hive, a kitten in-—”</dia>
<dia>“There, there — you need not call me any more odd things.”</dia> —

They pointed to the spot on which the tent of the gipsies had stood; — and Helena described eagerly to Mamma, precisely where, and how, <fidquotes>"the yellow woman began to run away with her.”</fidquotes>

They then pursued the path that led them up the mountain. The lakes began to lessen to their view; yet still the summit appeared to rise as they approached. Vast oaks, intermingled with the mountain-ash, were so far beneath their feet, that they obstructed not their view. — They now discovered a small spot that was sufficiently level to make them a seat, on which they might rest, and admire the stupendous prospect around them. — Hills, surmounting hills, winding rivers, and rocks of a mellow grey, nearly covered with shrubs, and tangled bushes of the richest green, presented to their delighted eyes, all the glorious varieties of nature.

<diam>"O how beautiful, Mamma!” <m>cried Helena</m>.</diam> <diam>"It is sublime!” <m>said Mr. Melcombe.</m></diam>

After a few minutes of silent contemplation he added,

<diaq>"The sun begins to redden, and grow broader. — I think we may safely watch its setting brightness, and yet reach home before it is dark.”</diaq>

No one was inclined to move, and they saw its last beams upon the golden lakes (for such they appeared), and the lengthened shadows of the towering hills, at last, gradually vanished from their eyes.

<diam>"'T is a pity,” <m>said Mrs. Villiers,</m> “but we must hasten homewards: I already fear the evening dews for Helena, who is very susceptible of cold.”</diam>

Helena sprang up in a moment, and approached nearer the edge...

<scenedia>On the following morning, Mrs. Villiers, having spent some hours in the instruction of Helena, dismissed her to her amusements in the garden: and Helena, <trigger>perceiving</trigger> an <chnonameintro>old man</chnonameintro> who was frequently employed to work in it, and with whom she had formed the <i>strictest friendship</i>, was presently at his side. She would often stand near him, watching him at his occupation, and asking him a hundred pretty questions, which he was ever ready to answer, and sometimes would she busily employ herself, under his directions, and delight in fancying that she was of prodigious use to him in his labours. She had been thus engaged for about an hour, while Mrs. Villiers had been sitting at her work. Helena entered —

<diaq>"Pray, mamma, what sort of a place is London ?”</diaq>
<dia>"A large question, Helena: perhaps you may see one day or other; but what put London in your head just now ?”</dia>
<dia>"Why, mamma, old Bernard says it’s the D—l’s Country — naughty word you know! — he says he saw him there, and told me a great deal about it; it’s a very pretty story, mamma; do, let him tell it you himself.”</dia>
<dia>"Old Bernard talks nonsense; — but my dear child, how you have heated yourself! what have you been about ?”</dia>

<dia>"A large question, Helena: perhaps you may see one day or other; but what put London in your head just now ?”</dia>

I see you have had good success: —- you come loaded with spoil. I hope, however, that you made sure work with the parties concerned, and suffered no informers to escape."</diam>
<diam>"Nay, reverend father," <m>replied Sangnigno, the lieutenant of the band, who now led the van</m>, —- "though men be valiant, they cannot always be successful. This unlucky night we have got nothing but hard blows: witness our gallant captain there, carried on the shoulders of four of our brave comrades, and, I fear, completely disabled from ever again following the honorable profession of arms. He is so dangerously wounded, that we could not venture to carry him back to the garrison in his present condition; but were obliged to fetch him hither to have his wounds dressed."</diam>
<diam>"Not a moment shall be lost," <m>answered the prior</m>. -— "Take him up quick to the infirmary; you know the way. And you," <m>added he, turning to Serafino</m>, "run, and instantly call up father Innocent and the infirmarian, to give the captain medical assistance: then haste to my closet, and fetch a bottle of liqueur, that I may give him a cordial to revive his spirits."</diam>

Serafino, in obedience to the prior's commands, instantly flew to execute his commission; when, as the party advanced in slow procession along the cloister, <diam>"I hope," <m>whispered father Fidele, who by this time had joined the prior</m>, —- "I hope the rogues are not cheating us of our share of the booty, as they have already done once or twice before."</diam> —- <diam>"Hush!" <m>said the prior</m>,  -— "we'll talk of that anon. -— You see what a condition the captain is reduced to: he will certainly have recourse to confession and absolution before he dies: I shall then learn the true state of the case; and we will afterwards act accordingly."</diam>

Arrived in the infirmary, the four robbers, who supported their wounded chief, gently laid him down upon a couch, pale, speechless, and wholly bereft of motion. —- Father Innocent and the infirmarian soon made their appearance, followed by Serafino with a flask of the prior's choicest liqueur: and, while the compassionate prior poured a cordial down the patient's throat, Innocent examined and wiped his wounds, and the infirmarian, by his direc...

I would fain know the secrets of the grave, and ascertain whether the spirit be chained after death to its earthly covering of clay, condemned till the day of final resurrection to hover over the rotting mass of corruption that once contained it; or whether the last agonies of death free it from its mortal ties, and leave it floating, free as air, in the bright regions of ethereal space?"</diam>

Glaphyra would have excused herself; but no excuse was allowed; and she then hastened to acquaint her parents of her intention, and to slip on a riding-dress.

On her re-entrance at the house of Lady Lawson, she found Lady Horneck's carriage at the door; Mr. Lessingham, at the distance of a few paces, in his phaeton; and the different servants, with the horses, in waiting.

Lessingham, as soon as he saw Glaphyra, gave the reins to his servant; and joining her, he said -— <diaq>"Miss Laviton, how unfortunate, that I cannot have the pleasure of offering you a seat in my carriage -— this foolish engagement -— yet I rejoice to see you intend being of our party: I hope your amiable sensibility towards Lady Horneck has done you no injury."</diaq>

Glaphyra smiled: <dia>"I was happy in the little assistance I was able to afford her; but you will scarcely believe me when I tell you that she is to be of the party this morning, and to drive me in her curricle."</dia>

Arrayed in the extreme of fashion, Miss Pollet made her <i>entré</i>.

Glaphyra looked at her with astonishment.

Her flaxen locks (for which she was un-indebted to nature) were drawn up in a point at the top of her head, with a profusion of combs and bows, every one of which was ornamented with an arrow; beneath these luxuriant tresses projected a thin narrow face, a sharp nose, a long pointed chin, with a pair of little grey eyes, which were continually upon the stretch to gather information; her complexion was sallow; her form thin, spare, and inelegant; and a dress, rather fine than clean or neat, contributed in no small degree to render her person disgusting: yet so little had Miss Pollet studied self-knowledge, that <authorwe>we verily believe</authorwe>, of all her acquaintance, she was the only person inclined to allow that the sister of Lady Lawson might still be considered handsome, and that what she had lost in youth she had gained in dignity of manners -— an agreeableness in that <i>je ne sçai quoi</i> generally yeleped knowledge of the world.

<sceneaction>Nugent's letter, and a much more brief one from his gay companion, being concluded, the two young men turned their entire attention to their patient and their prisoners. General Colville now occupied the bed in the only retiring-room which the house contained; the wounded and captive ruffians were laid upon straw, in an out-house, under a guard of peasants; and the rest of the party, that is to say, Prankendahi, Nugent, the valet, the landlord, his daughter, her husband, and the boatmen, assembled in the kitchen to await the arrival of the surgeon, and of the <i>amt-mann</i>, or rural magistrate, whose residence was about a mile distant, and to whom a peasant had been dispatched, to make a statement of the case.

Dorothea now displayed the combined fare of her larder, dairy, and cellar —- sausages, eggs, milk, and <quotedlit>"bread of the coarsest sort, and meager wine,"</quotedlit> all of which the travellers were quite hungry enough to enjoy. In the intervals of eating, much conversation was carried on concerning the incidents of the night; many conjectures were formed; and Frankendahl and Nugent, in answer to their questions, were told several anecdotes of Stoblitz's villany; he was a boatman of the neighbourhood, and all united in giving him a very bad character. Ludwig stated, that general Colville had been several times at his house, on his way to and from Baden, and other places in the vicinity, describing him as a gentleman of respectability and honour, said to be rich, and by all acknowledged to be generous.

<diam>"What family has general Colville?" <m>asked Nugent</m>.</diam>
<diam>"Only himself and his wife," <m>replied the landlord</m>.</diam>
<diam>"He has no wife — at least none here," <m>said Francis, the fisherman</m></diam>.

<diam>"Who was that handsome lady who was here with him one day then?" <m>questioned Ludwig.</m></diam>
<diam>"Dare say that was his daughter," <m>said Dorothea.</m></diam>
<diam>"No, she is his niece," <m>rejoined Francis.</m></diam>
<diam>"Dare say thou's wrong," <m>said his wife.</m></diam>
<diam>"No, I have heard her call the general uncle more than once, when I have been at St. Severine with fish," <m>returned Francis; and the assertion of course concluded this part of the colloquy.</m></diam>

Nugent was now impatiently expecting the arrival of the surgeon. -— <diam>"Is he a person of skill?" <m>he asked, but without a hope of having the question satisfactorily answered; for he supposed that those ignorant peasants had the same confidence in a wandering quack that savage tribes place in their conjurers.</m></diam>
<diam>"He is a right good doctor, sir, and does many wonderful cure...

Beverley thought he would soon awake, and <arrivaldeparture>when Dorothea came on tiptoe</arrivaldeparture> to announce that the coffee was ready, he requested her to bring it in, cherishing the hope that the general would find himself sufficiently refreshed to partake of it. She soon returned, and either the effect of the medicine was over, or the noise made in placing the table, dispersed it, for general Colville started, and opened his eyes. Nugent bent anxiously forwards, so that his youthful countenance was the first object the general beheld. He gazed on him earnestly, yet with visible wildness of manner, and exclaimed — <diaq>"My Maria!"</diaq>
<diam>"Dear heart, he calls on the Virgin," <m>said Dorothea.</m></diam>

Nugent suffered her to think so; but he knew, from the manner in which the words were spoken, that they were not intended for a Catholic invocation. Some one had said, the preceding evening, that general Colville had a niece; and Beverley supposed that, in the first bewildered moment of returning recollection, he had mistaken him for her.

"<diam>How do you feel yourself, my dear sir?" <m>said Nugent, in English.</m></diam>

His voice seemed to dispel the illusion, and again starting, as if from a dream, Colville exclaimed — <diaq>"Where am I?"</diaq>
<diam>"Safe, and amongst friends, sir, who will pay you every attention," <m>replied Beverley.</m></diam>
<diam>"I remember it all," <m>he exclaimed</m>; "my villainous servant was about to murder me, when some one came to my rescue, and fired on the assassins: to you then, generous, noble young man, I owe my life;"</diam> and as he spoke he stretched out his hand, and fervently pressed that of Nugent, who modestly replied — <diaq>"No, indeed, my dear sir, I was only one, and not the most active, of your deliverers; it was a young German nobleman, with whom I travel, who so bravely fired on, and disabled your infamous valet; and the men in whose boat we happened to be...

She then stood up, and approaching a little dark well which issued in silence from beneath the roots of a blasted oak, almost concealed by rushes, reeds, and flags, she took up a small cup chained to a flag by the well; and raising her eyes to Heaven, in much apparent devotion, she drank of the water, then went three times round the well on her knees, again smote her breast, and, again weeping bitterly, she stood up and walked hastily on.

This large and ancient book, my child, was given to my grandsire by St. Patrick. They met at the royal palace in Cashel; a friendship took place between them, and, when they were parting, St. Patrick presented my grandsire with this blessed book, which holy men, inspired by the Spirit of God, wrote for our instruction.

"I cannot rightly account for it, but I think the perusal of it, -— I don't know how it is," <m>continued the old knight, musing</m>, "but I don't feel as much in love with the faith of my ancestors as I was: I must read on; perhaps by persevering in the perusal I may meet with some sentiment that may set my mind at rest; but it is only on immaterial points I am puzzled," <m>added the old knight</m>, "for, since I began the blessed study, it has pleased God to prove to me the full and perfect expiation my Saviour's death has made for sin; <i>this</i> glorious truth appears to me in the clearest view."</diam>

<sceneaction>The sun was sinking in the west, <trigger>when</trigger> a <chnonameexternal>Stranger</chnonameexternal> seated himself on the summit of one of the Cheviot hills, and looked anxiously on the land below. The apple was red and ripening on the tree, the nuts were brown in their husks, the rowans' bitter bunch hung glossy amidst the green bough; the wild plums grew in black and powdery clusters; the sweet green junipers were in full flavour; the nest of the wild bee was filled with honey; and hill, wood, and dale, showed that summer had fulfilled all the purposes for which nature had given it light and warmth. He saw, too, the sickle in the hands of the reapers moving beneath the ears of yellow corn, the husbandman rubbing the heads in his hand, and looking if the grain was round and ripe; and he heard a song which gave an image of the season, from the lips of two maidens, who bore out food to the harvest field. The green hills presented a similar picture of pastoral abundance. The sunward sides were white over with flocks, shepherds walked among them, thinking on the romantic rivulet bank where the folds stood, and where they could see the maidens at bughting time; from the cheese presses was taken the well-formed and well-pressed curd, and the master of the household weighed the fleece which his flock had yielded, and calculated the growing wealth of his possessions. Away on the Stranger's left rolled the wide and restless sea, with all its winding outline of coast; and on his right many a feudal castle displayed its banner, while the arms of the warders gleamed bright in the descending sun.

The Stranger gazed awhile on the varied scene, and said, <monologue>"Alas! green isle, had a brazen wall begirt thee, it would not have shut out slaughter. The south oppresses the north, and the north resists in bitterness and blood. Never will my native isle have happiness, till one trumpet warns its people to war, till they sing to the sound of the same pipe, till they bow to the breath of the same law, till they eat at the same table, and drink of the same cup.

<sceneaction>The sun was sinking in the west, <trigger>when</trigger> a <chnonameexternal>Stranger</chnonameexternal> seated himself on the summit of one of the Cheviot hills, and looked anxiously on the land below. The apple was red and ripening on the tree, the nuts were brown in their husks, the rowans' bitter bunch hung glossy amidst the green bough; the wild plums grew in black and powdery clusters; the sweet green junipers were in full flavour; the nest of the wild bee was filled with honey; and hill, wood, and dale, showed that summer had fulfilled all the purposes for which nature had given it light and warmth. He saw, too, the sickle in the hands of the reapers moving beneath the ears of yellow corn, the husbandman rubbing the heads in his hand, and looking if the grain was round and ripe; and he heard a song which gave an image of the season, from the lips of two maidens, who bore out food to the harvest field. The green hills presented a similar picture of pastoral abundance. The sunward sides were white over with flocks, shepherds walked among them, thinking on the romantic rivulet bank where the folds stood, and where they could see the maidens at bughting time; from the cheese presses was taken the well-formed and well-pressed curd, and the master of the household weighed the fleece which his flock had yielded, and calculated the growing wealth of his possessions. Away on the Stranger's left rolled the wide and restless sea, with all its winding outline of coast; and on his right many a feudal castle displayed its banner, while the arms of the warders gleamed bright in the descending sun.

The Stranger gazed awhile on the varied scene, and said, <monologue>"Alas! green isle, had a brazen wall begirt thee, it would not have shut out slaughter. The south oppresses the north, and the north resists in bitterness and blood. Never will my native isle have happiness, till one trumpet warns its people to war, till they sing to the sound of the same pipe, till they bow to the breath of the same law, till they eat at the same table, and drink of the same cup. Then shall her united strength make the nations be just, then shall her ships cover the ocean, and she shall be empress of the deep."</monologue> He uttered this in the calm and confident tone of one who gives judgment rather than expresses a wish, or hazards an opinion. He still continued to look at the scene before him.

Why would ye rob the soldier of the spoil he has honourably won?"</diaq>" <diam>"James," <m>answered the other,</m> "you speak as your gross sight informs you; I act as the mind directs. He who bore these in battle last, bore them not unworthily, for he was a brave prince, but he obeyed the dark glances of fair dames; he was a slave to sight which is sensual; and a lady's smile won more from his hand than the words of gray-headed wisdom. This sword and dagger, robe and cup, are too pure to be polluted by vulgar hands. They were made for the great Robert Bruce, when he warred for Scotland's freedom; with this good blade he dyed the brook of Bannock, and wearing this robe he dispensed righteous judgment and prudent mercy among his people. Judge ye, therefore, if it be meet that such things should be profaned by common hands. Even out of this act shall I read you a lesson fit for a prince to hear. These spoils would have proved the ruin of these men. Over them, blades would have been bared, and life's blood spilt. I spared these men, to be a scourge to the rich priests and opulent nobles of this haughty land."</diam>
<diam>"I know these spoils right well," <m>said Sir James,</m> "and common legends say that the sword was forged in a fairy fire, and the robe wrought in a fairy loom. Such is the tale of our poetic peasantry. For me, any blade that can cut through a steel casque, or any robe that keeps a soldier from the night dew, is as good as aught forged in visionary fires, or woven in imaginary looms."</diam> Sir Michael smiled, and answered, <diaq>"James, thou wert ever an unbeliever, and with the King didst scorn the spirit which came to warn him from the war; like him, too, thou didst slight the terrible voice which summoned all the nobles afterwards slain at Flodden-edge, to answer at the judgment-seat. Thou wilt change thy creed before the green hills of Scotland feel thy feet again. Thou art doomed to a severe pilgrimage."</diaq>
<diam>"It will be a strange journey," <m>replied the knight,</m> "which can make me believe that this old war-worn robe is of supernatural weft, and this little sharp broad blade is not a piece of good Damascus steel. But I am glad I have the good sword once more in my hand. I wish to die as a soldier should. Here is the tent of Surrey, and thus I confront the nobl...

<sceneaction>About midnight, however, the trampling of horses, and the voices of their riders, interrupted his rest; but not until they had gained that part of the wood where MONTMORIN had taken up his residence. He soon overheard enough of their discourse to learn their profession; a gang of banditti was what he had not been prepared to expect, and he had little inclination to offer his services as umpire, for the accommodation of an eager dispute, in which the fraternity were engaged, on the distribution of some newly acquired plunder.

From <i>invectives</i> the disputants soon proceeded to <i>blows</i>, -- but these were suspended on a proposition for leaving the spoil undivided, and under a guard of two of the party, whilst the others made a second excursion before daybreak.

The anxious inhabitant of the tree, conjectured the number of morroders to be not less than twelve; whilst they continued occupied in their noisy contention, the sighs of a female captive were drowned in the din of these ruffians. She had just fallen into their hands; and, about her, their principal quarrel had arisen.

The earliest glimmer of returning day, discovered to his sight this figure laying at the foot of a tree, her arms bound together; and on each side lay one of the banditti with a drawn scymetar: of these guards only one was awake, and he was endeavouring to avail himself of his comrade's drowsiness, for the accomplishment of his own designs on their unfortunate captive.

The noise which resistance to this brutal attempt occasioned, alarming the sleeper, he started up; if not to defend the helpless, yet, to prevent his fellow centinel from profiting by his wakefulness; and with one well aimed blow of his weapon (which was ready drawn) almost severed the head of his companion from the body. At sight of this horrid scene, the wretched female uttered a loud shriek, and fainted; in vain did the robber use every method within his power for her recovery. At length (taking from one of the packages of plunder, a small gold cup) he went for water, to a murmuring brook at a little distance.

At the instant of his departure, MONTMORIN slid down from the tree, and (arming himself with the sword of the deceased) expected the return of the robber, who, on his return was so struck with the appearance he beheld, that he stood motionless; and, undetermined whether he saw the <i>phantom</i> of the man whom he had killed, or an <i>Officer of Justice</i>.

MONTMORIN, however, soon convinced the villain that he was not a visitor from the other world. A stern summons to surrender himself, was followed by a contest, in which the ruffian lost one entire cheek: frantic with rage, he fought on for some minutes, and gave his opponent a severe wound on the left arm, at the instant before he himself received a decisive blow on the neck, whi...
