Allen, who appeared greatly disturbed, and, coming up to his master, said in a most agitated manner, <diaq>"Thornton is coming!"</diaq>
<diam>"Thornton!" <m>exclaimed Wilford</m>, "Thornton! and to <i>my</i> house?"</diam>
<diam>"Ay, Thornton is coming, sure enough," <m>replied Abel</m>; "and I don’t think he is coming alone either, for I saw him standing in the green lane near Gammer Plaise’s cottage, with a couple of fellows of his own kidney, and I do think there was more of them still behind. But who cares for that?" added the old servingman stoutly; "shall I knock him down, or shut the door in his face?"</diam>
<diam>"Do neither," <m>replied Wilford;</m> "I will not refuse to see him; although, if I did so refuse, I could find a warrant for it in my own breast. Yet, I will see him.

<diam>"Nay, do not bid me," <m>replied his wife in an imploring tone</m>; "do not bid me; consider what it is."</diam>

<sceneaction>The next morning was spent in receiving visitors, who left them only time to prepare for the play, to which they had engaged to go with the Marchmonts, some time before; places were taken in the stage-box, and Sophia’s dress was remarkably elegant; she looked beautifully; the Marchmonts called for them, and she stepped into the carriage with more than usual vivacity. Lord Sandford was their only <i>escorte</i>, who was under an engagement for part of the evening, which would oblige him to

#65#

leave them when they were seated; but he promised to return before they would wish to leave the house. The play was one of Mrs. Cowley’s excellent comedies, and the third act was begun, which engaged all Sophia’s attention, when the audience were suddenly alarmed by the cry of <reportedspeechquotes>"Fire;"</reportedspeechquotes> the theatre was instantly in confusion, and the audience, by attempting to make their way out, rendered the scene still more frightful. --- Screams of terror and distress, -— the bursting open of doors, -- oaths and supplications, -- mixed in one dreadful tumult, terrified Sophia to agony; she jumped immediately over the benches behind her, and opening the door of the box, <exclamation>rushed instantly into the lobby!</exclamation> -— Here her situation was indeed frightful: encompassed by a crowd of people, who regarded only themselves, she vainly supplicated assistance; at length, her elegant figure attracting the attention of a party of young men, whose licentiousness, not

even the horror of the moment could repress; they seized her hand, and said they would protect her: the terrible imprecations they used to each other, awakened her to all the misery of her state, and the sound of protection, which had at first a little relieved her, from them, was even more dreadful than remaining unassisted. <diam>"No, no," <m>she exclaimed, endeavouring to disengage herself from them,</m> "suffer me to return to my friends, and I will share their fate."</diam> <diam>"We are your friends," <m>said they,</m> "and we will protect you."</diam> In saying this, they endeavoured to force her forward; the alarm had by this time ceased, and the lobby was almost empty: observing this, she hastily replied, <diaq>"No, there is no occasion, I thank you, gentlemen, the danger is over, and I will return to my party."</diaq> To this she received no answer, but an insolent laugh, some impertinent speeches to each other, and a continued effort to oblige her to go

with them. Wresting herself violently from their hold, she exclaimed, <diaq>"Unhand me, gentlemen, I will not go with you.”</diaq> A gentleman advancing, used some menacing language to these insolent fellows -— S...

in stature than Sophia, but the graces of her person prevented her from being insignificant. In short, she had just that kind of elegant attraction which wins the heart without consulting, or rather before it is possible to consult the reasons. They entered immediately into a very friendly conversation; and Sophia said, <diaq>“I trust, Lady Helen, you will not mortify me so cruelly, as just to shew me there exists a person so valuable as yourself, and then withdraw her from my society: will you add to the obligations I already feel half uneasy under, that of allowing me to see you often."</diaq> <diam>"On one condition;" <m>replied Lady Helen, smiling.</m></diam> <diam>“Name it;” <m>answered Sophia.</m></diam> <dia>“It is that you will not ever again mention, that horrid word <i>obligations</i>; if you do, I shall think you wish to remind <i>me</i> of those I owe <i>you</i> for admitting me; and, like you, I am very proud, and <i>hate to be obliged</i>.”</dia> Sophia returned her smile, and in the same tone promised

implicit obedience. <diainset1p>"My time," <m>said Lady Helen</m>, "while my father is out of town, is quite at my own disposal; and I find already, that I shall think most of that mispent, which is not passed with you: when my father is at home, I must dedicate a large part of every day to him. It is remarkabable enough," <m>added she,</m> “that but yesterday morning, I was saying to my brother <diaq>'I hear a great deal of Lady Sophia Woodville, I wish we could be introduced to her; but as we are unacquainted with Lord Marchmont’s family and most of those she visits, I fear it will not be easy.’</diaq> <diam>‘Oh,' <m>said he, smiling,</m> 'do not wish that for my sake, Helen, for I am told she is so extremely lovely, no man can withstand the power of her charms, and I wish to keep my heart awhile.'</diam>"</diainset1p> Sophia felt herself excessively confused at this recital, and with some difficulty said, <diaq>"Your Brother is by this time undeceived, if indeed, he ever <i>thought</i> thus."</diaq> Lady...

The green hills presented a similar picture of pastoral abundance. The sunward sides were white over with flocks, shepherds walked among them, thinking on the romantic rivulet bank where the folds stood, and where they could see the maidens at bughting time; from the cheese presses was taken the well-formed and well-pressed curd, and the master of the household weighed the fleece which his flock had yielded, and calculated the growing wealth of his possessions.

wisdom. This sword and dagger, robe and cup, are too pure to be polluted by vulgar hands. They were made for the great Robert Bruce, when he warred for Scotland’s freedom; with this good blade he dyed the brook of Bannock, and wearing this robe he dispensed righteous judgment and prudent mercy among his people. Judge ye, therefore, if it be meet that such things should be profaned by common hands. Even out of this act shall I read you a lesson fit for a prince to hear. These spoils would have proved the ruin of these men. Over them, blades would have been bared, and life’s blood spilt.

<diam>"I know these spoils right well," <m>said Sir James,</m> "and common legends say that the sword was forged in a fairy fire, and the robe wrought in a fairy loom.

the serene expanse</m>, "to sit fool in the middle for the companionship of a woman of ton, a man of fashion, an antiquated soldier, and a thrifty dame! What sin have I committed that must be atoned for by such a mental flagellation!"</monologue>

While he spoke, he fortunately recollected he was now alone; and pronouncing a very devout address to the gracions Goddess of Liberty, he resolved to abandon himself to the felicity she for the present benignly granted him.

<rhetoricalq><reader>Reader</reader>, have you ever visited this charming country?</rhetoricalq> It is the birth place of <authori>my ancestors</authori> — this can only impress myself; <exclamation>but it is also the scene of a romance striking, eloquent, and seductive! Sir William had also found it dangerous!</exclamation> ’Twas true, his understanding was awake to the necessity of certain restrictions in moral society, and deemed the man a profligate who argued for their subversion:

#78#

but to read a mere recital was neither to argue, to practise, or to justify its moral defects; and he read it repeatedly, and with new pleasure

<monologue>"It must be owned,” <m>said he</m>, "there is something of St. Prieux in my composition. Those vivid sensations, those glowing delights, those unsubjugated fancies, are all features of myself. If I found an Eloisa who could bewitch my senses, I should make no scruple to abandon myself to her control. This would be to prosecute my rambles in the happiest state of perfection!"</monologue>

Musingly he walked forward. His imagination took the reins and drove him at headlong speed. He almost fancied himself in search of the object with whom, to realize the picture. His steps wandered by the lake, whose ripling waters, curling in the moon's beams, soothed his senses to tranquillity. A distant clock at length

#79#

sounded on his ear, and he returned to seek the path from which he now discovered he had strayed.

To recover it was not however so easy. He missed his way through the windings of the rocks, and finding himself more deeply involved in the labyrinth of an unbeaten track, he endeavoured to descry a human habitation from which he could enquire his way. Even this was difficult; till happening to range round the foot of a barren hill, he accidentally discovered a dim light. On approaching he found it proceeded from a solitary hovel, and hastening towards it, he smartly knocked at the door.

<diam>"Fanchon," <m>said a voice of impatience within, and immediately the door was opened</m> —- "Fanchon, why did you stay so long?"</diam>

<dia>"Ah mamma!”</dia>
<diam>"We shall see about him,” <m>said Mrs. Mellrose, nodding an additional assurance as she left the room.</m></diam>

Annette looked mysteriously as her mistress shut the door. <diam>"What signifies all my lady can do for him?” <m>said she, with an air of sagacity.</m> "He has a troubled spirit.”</diam>
<dia>"How do you know that?”</dia>
<dia>"It’s plain to be seen, mademoiselle.

If he had not, do you suppose he would sit there, never turning his head no more than if he was made of wood? Besides, mademoiselle knows that if he was quiet, like other people, he would chuse to sit from morning to night instead of from night to morning."</dia>

The surmise was sufficiently obvious; and <arrivaldeparture>Annette being called away</arrivaldeparture>, Julia was left to sum up her own conjectures.

<diam>"But he may not be incurable,” <m>said she</m>, "and <i>we shall see about him</i>."</diam>

<scenedia>By the time Helena had assisted her maid to unpack her cloaths, and she had equipped herself, it was past nine; she therefore bent her way to the breakfast parlour, which she found empty, but all appeared prepared for its soon being occupied; she took up a book that was on the table, to amuse herself till some one should approach, <trigger>but she had scarcely turned over two leaves ere lord Charles entered</trigger>, exclaiming, <diaq>“good morrow to my sweet sister, you look like the bright goddess of day emerging from a cloud; I shall” <m>continued he</m>, “be much mortified if I find you have long been here by yourself; I should have deserted the antients to converse with modern beauties, and left Mr. Nowel to study by himself.

It was accordingly conveyed to his grace, who was as dinner with a large party and his two sons tire the marquis of Huntley and lord Charles Sidney. 

On perusing the letter, the duke turned pale, and his countenance expressed an emotion of the deepest concern. He had no sooner made an end of it, than he apologized to the company for leaving them, but that a dying friend, requested his presence at the distance of thirty miles. He then ordered his carriage to be got ready in a moment, and, having desired lord Huntley to supply his place, went up to the dutchess while his orders were obeyed. Illness confined her grace to her dressing room; and, after a short

<sceneaction><trigger>The next day,</trigger> the lessons commenced in Mrs. Villiers’s dressing-room — an elegant little apartment, overlooking the garden, to which descended a small flight of steps. Beyond that, lay a meadow, where the white poney ranged by the side of a river, flow-

ing through a country that might flatter the imagination of an enthusiast with the ideas of the Vale of Tempé, or the Groves of Paradise.

When the lesson was over, the whole party repaired again to the garden. Helena had been attentive, and had leave to gambol without restraint. She was soon in full flight round the walks; and Frederick, like a young Apollo, close behind her. In a few minutes afterward, he was pulling, up hill, at a large rolling-stone, with his utmost strength. On the lower ground, in the same walk, with her head averted from her play-fellow, stood Helena, in deep meditation on a beautiful caterpillar which she had just picked up. Frederick, while endeavouring to secure his hold of the handle, let it suddenly slip from his grasp, and the roller ran rapidly down the walk.

Mrs. Villiers, seeing Helena’s situation, uttered a shriek of terror. Mr. Melcombe was by her side: — she staggered — he, in a moment, extended his arms; and caught

#31#

her, fainting, as she fell. Frederick was calling out to Helena, with all the strength of his voice,

<dia>"Away — away from the roller"</dia> — <descriptor>and waving his hand to hasten her.</descriptor>

She had turned at the rumbling of the stone, and the shriek of her mother; and had skipped off on a flower-bed, while the roller passed violently by. Frederick ran up to her, and, gently slapping her cheek, cried out —

<diaq>"Why, Helena, how dare you frighten me so ?”</diaq>
<dia>"How dare you make me jump upon those two beautiful carnations? There! I have broke both their necks.”</dia>
<dia>"Never mind the carnations, my dear little girl; I thought I had killed you!”</dia> — <descriptor>and he gasped, and panted, and, trying to laugh, fairly sobbed upon her shoulder.</descriptor> They now turned up the walk.

<diam>"Hol—-lo” — cried Frederick, still trembling, "What’s the matter with Mrs. Villiers ?”</diam>
<dia>"Where? what? — Mamma! — where?"</dia>

#32#


Mr. Melcombe was supporting her to the house — Frederick flew to assist, and Helena flew after him, crying,

<diaq>"Mamma, dear mamma! I am quite well: — the roller did not hurt me — pray, pray, look up at me!”</diaq>

<diaq>"With Mr. Melcombe’s duty to Miss Villiers.”</diaq>
<diam>"How kind is Mr. Melcombe!” <m>said Mrs. Villiers.</m></diam>
<dia>"Mr. Melcombe’s <i>duty</i> to <i>me</i>, mamma!”</dia> <descriptor>— and she laughed, and chuckled, for a minute</descriptor>; and then, with assumed dignity, befitting the occasion, prepared to receive them graciously: when Frederick, having lost his gravity, — and his balance, tumbled them all on the floor.

#16#

geon, and of the <i>amt-mann</i>, or rural magistrate, whose residence was about a mile distant, and to whom a peasant had been dispatched, to make a statement of the case.

Dorothea now displayed the combined fare of her larder, dairy, and cellar —- sausages, eggs, milk, and <quotedlit>"bread of the coarsest sort, and meager wine,”</quotedlit> all of which the travellers were quite hungry enough to enjoy. In the intervals of eating, much conversation was carried on concerning the incidents of the night; many conjectures were formed; and Frankendahl and Nugent, in answer to their questions, were told several anecdotes of Stoblitz’s villany; he was a boatman of the neighbourhood, and all united in giving him a very bad character. Ludwig stated, that general Colville had been several times at his house, on his way to and from Baden, and other places in the vicinity, describing him as a gentleman of respectability and ho-

#17#

nour, said to be rich, and by all acknowledged to be generous.

<diam>"What family has general Colville?” <m>asked Nugent</m>.</diam>
<diam>"Only himself and his wife,” <m>replied the landlord</m>.</diam>
<diam>"He has no wife — at least none here,” <m>said Francis, the fisherman</m></diam>.

<diam>"Who was that handsome lady who was here with him one day then?” <m>questioned Ludwig.</m></diam>
<diam>"Dare say that was his daughter,” <m>said Dorothea.</m></diam>
<diam>"No, she is his niece,” <m>rejoined Francis.</m></diam>
<diam>"Dare say thou’s wrong,” <m>said his wife.</m></diam>
<diam>“No, I have heard her call the general uncle more than once, when I have been at St. Severine with fish,” <m>returned Francis; and the assertion of course concluded this part of the colloquy.</m></diam>

Nugent was now impatiently expecting the arrival of the surgeon. -— <diam>"Is he

#18#

a person of skill?” <m>he asked, but without a hope of having the question satisfactorily answered; for he supposed that those ignorant peasants had the same confidence in a wandering quack that savage tribes place in their conjurers.</m></diam>

Beverley thought he would soon awake, and <arrivaldeparture>when Dorothea came on tiptoe</arrivaldeparture> to announce that the coffee was ready, he requested her to bring it in, cherishing the hope that the general would find himself sufficiently refreshed to partake of it. She soon returned, and either the effect of the medicine was over, or the noise made in placing the table, dispersed it, for general Colville started, and opened his eyes. Nugent bent anxiously forwards, so that his youthful countenance was the first object the general beheld. He gazed on him ear-

#55#

nestly, yet with visible wildness of manner, and exclaimed — <diaq>"My Maria!"</diaq>
<diam>"Dear heart, he calls on the Virgin,” <m>said Dorothea.</m></diam>

Nugent suffered her to think so; but he knew, from the manner in which the words were spoken, that they were not intended for a Catholic invocation. Some one had said, the preceding evening, that general Colville had a niece; and Beverley supposed that, in the first bewildered moment of returning recollection, he had mistaken him for her.

"<diam>How do you feel yourself, my dear sir?" <m>said Nugent, in English.</m></diam>

His voice seemed to dispel the illusion, and again starting, as if from a dream, Colville exclaimed — <diaq>"Where am I?"</diaq>
<diam>"Safe, and amongst friends, sir, who will pay you every attention," <m>replied Beverley.</m></diam>
<diam>"I remember it all," <m>he exclaimed</m>; "my villainous servant was about to

murder me, when some one came to my rescue, and fired on the assassins: to you then, generous, noble young man, I owe my life;"</diam> and as he spoke he stretched out his hand, and fervently pressed that of Nugent, who modestly replied — <diaq>"No, indeed, my dear sir, I was only one, and not the most active, of your deliverers; it was a young German nobleman, with whom I travel, who so bravely fired on, and disabled your infamous valet; and the men in whose boat we happened...

The duke and Sir Ambrose were always glad to meet, but as the present occasion was one of more than ordinary interest, so they now greeted each other with more than ordinary pleasure. The duke had always been warmly attached to Edmund, and his voice actually trembled with agitation as he exclaimed: --

<diam>"I am, indeed, half mad," <m>returned Edric, with a melancholy smile</m>; "and yet, perhaps, you will laugh when I tell you the reason of my uneasiness: to say truth, the conversation we had together the other day has occasioned it. You convinced me so clearly of the

possibility of resuscitating a dead body, that since that moment I have been tormented by an earnest desire to communicate with one who has been an inhabitant of the tomb. I would fain know the secrets of the grave, and ascertain whether the spirit be chained after death to its earthly covering of clay, condemned till the day of final resurrection to hover over the rotting mass of corruption that once contained it; or whether the last agonies of death free it from its mortal ties, and leave it floating, free as air, in the bright regions of ethereal space?"</diam>

<scenedia>Miss Fordyce was under some anxiety respecting her friend’s return, as it had struck twelve; and she could in no way account for her staying to so late an hour with Stanly, romantic as she was, though she knew it was the custom for, lovers to walk together by moonlight, <quotesother>"when the song of the birds is no longer heard in the groves, and nature seems hushed to repose, save the

Nightingale who tunes her love-labored ditty.”</quotesother> Though she knew that then was the time for lovers to whisper their soft tales, yet that night was far from answering the above description. It was a night when <quotesother>"the loud winds roared amongst the tenantry of the forest, and the pityless pelting of the storm was heard around, while the melancholy boding Raven, from the hollow oak or ivy-mantled turret, gave to the blast his harsh discordant notes."</quotesother> It was on such a night, when <quotesother>"distressed damsels are rescued by valorous Knights, or some terrific spectral form is seen slow stalking with noiseless pace,"</quotesother> there was no grove, no Nightingale, no purling rill, or rolling orb of night: but the melancholy voice of the hoarse watchman, who yawned the midnight hour, and the noise of the rain as it poured down the gutters.

glided Emily to the parlour where Miss Fordyce was sitting: but ah! how changed from what she was when she last saw her ! Her lovely eyes were red and swollen with weeping, her cheeks were pale, and her dress in disorder. Miss Fordyce was astonished at her appearance.

<diam>“Good heavens!” <m>said she,</m>&gt; "my dear Miss Henderson, what is the matter with you; are you not well; what has happened?”</diam>
<diam>"Nothing,” <m>faintly sighed Emily,</m> — "I am not very well: we were caught in the rain — Stanly had a quarrel — and---------"</diam>
<diam>"A quarrel! what, on your account? Oh! that is so romantic,” <m>said Miss Fordyce,</m> "but pray tell me all about it. How did he behave; did he fight bravely; how many did he wound; was it banditti that attacked him?”</diam>

Miss Fordyce was now all anxiety to

hear the adventures which, she had ho doubt, was similar to some she had read in romances, but was greatly disappointed to find that the parties concerned were only a drunken Lord and a Commoner equally so; who, as Emily said, <fidquotes>"would not let them pass quietly through the streets.”</fidquotes>
<diam>"Oh! is that all ?” <m>returned Miss Fordyce</m>: "however, I suppose there will be a duel; and that will be in all the newspapers. What pleasure I shall take in reading the account, particularly as I sh...

<sceneaction>They had only been a week at sea when they hailed the rock of Lisbon, and the next morning anchored at the castle. After the customary visits, they were permitted to go on shore, about three miles from the city; and while one of the crew, who understood the language, went to procure them one of the ugly carriages peculiar to the country, they waited in the Irish convent, which is situated close to the Tagus.

Some of the people offered to conduct them into the church, where there was a fine organ playing; Mary followed them, but Ann preferred staying with a nun she had entered into conversation with.

One of the nuns, who had a sweet voice, was singing; Mary was struck with awe; her heart joined in the devotion; and tears of gratitude and tenderness flowed from her eyes. <monologue>My Father, I thank thee!</monologue>

Silently, she surveyed the lofty dome; heard unaccustomed sounds; and saw faces, strange ones, that she could not yet greet with fraternal love.

In an unknown land, she considered that the Being she adored inhabited eternity, was ever present in unnumbered worlds. When she had not any one she loved near her, she was particularly sen-

sible of the presence of her Almighty Friend.

The arrival of the carriage put a stop to her speculations; it was to conduct them to an hotel, fitted up for the reception of invalids. Unfortunately, before they could reach it there was a violent shower of rain; and as the wind was very high, it beat against the leather curtains, which they drew along the front of the vehicle, to shelter themselves from it; but it availed not, some of the rain forced its way, and Ann felt the effects of it, for she caught cold, spite of Mary's precautions.</sceneaction>
